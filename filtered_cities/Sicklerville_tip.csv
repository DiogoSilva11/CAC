ZQnJI8dy7_KB-K5SYXHWWQ,ASli9FU9tdpvUQKgQ5zNIA,"The girl answering the phone and taking orders was SO rude and unprofessional. After I placed my order, she told me to cancel it because I wanted delivery. Why offer delivery if you Can't deliver? & why put a phone prompt for take out or delivery if it doesn't let you know? She was just RUDE, and then kept putting me on hold on top of that- to only tell me I couldn't get food. 
Sorry.. But a business won't thrive with that kind of service. Won't be calling or going there ever again",2016-08-26 22:01:49,0
