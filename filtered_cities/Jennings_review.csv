I'm surprised the ""system"" wasn't down. I hate I even gave them a second chance. Save your time and go a few exits up.

I give 4 stars only because the crab doesn't come out whole. You have to slide your fork along the shell to break it open. I think that means it's overcooked. More work that has to be done on top of the work already being done. Besides that, it's good!",2019-09-24 16:18:27

I am so dissatisfied with my experience here. I visited this place with two of my friends. Only one of us had the opportunity to enjoy a nice meal. My friend's order was rang in wrong and mine took over 30min to arrive to the table. Then get this... IT WAS WRONG WHEN IT ARRIVED!!! Not once BUT TWICEEEEEEE! Grrrr! By the time my food got to the table everyone was finished with their meals! A woman came to the table and introduced herself as the GENERAL MANAGER!  Disclaimer: She has to be related to the owners because her customer service was horrible!!!!NO EXPERIENCE! Before offering to remake my food she spent about 3 minutes explaining to me WHAT I DID TO MAKE MY ORDER WRONG as if I had the capability to ring it up and cook it myself. She offered to remake it... but then spent another 3 minutes rambling ,opposed to listening to the correct way I want my order. So, due to her lack of attentiveness, my order was wrong again! I asked for my $51.00 back and she told me that their system did not have the capability of refunding money! Sheesh! It got even more interesting when the owner came over and asked me what my issue was and thennnnn asked the GM for her side of the story RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME! I wasn't on the debate team in high school or college and am not debating about crab legs in a restaurant! The OWNER should've been informed of the situation before approaching the table! Then....he too refused to refund my money. He suggested that I wait ANOTHER 30 minutes on my food for the fourth time! I explained to him that at this point it was no longer about my food; I did not have the TIME to wait. After about 10 more minutes of talking I GOT A ONE TIME REFUND. Seriously?! Which baffled me because the  GM told me that it was IMPOSSIBLE!  
ALSO....GET THISSSSSSS..... the mother daughter duo next to me had an even worse complaint!!!! Her daughter NEVER got her food and NEVER received a refund! Say whaaaaaaa!!!! I thoroughly enjoy supporting black owned businesses ... but this was awful! You have to treat your customers better! To say that you won't refund $$$ in any situation is ridiculous; especially when your staff make several mistakes. I hope that this can serve as a learning experience to the owners and staff so that no customer will be treated like myself! If you make a mistake COMP THE MEAL! In what world do you tell a patron that hasn't received her correct order in what now has been over an hour ""SORRY YOU'RE S.O.L!"" 
Awful!!!! I hope they get better! Unfortunately, I won't be back!
I'm only giving them
2 stars because EVENTUALLY I received a refund!",2019-04-20 23:29:12

At first, the employee refused to speak English, no problem, maybe I wandered into some odd part of the country. I finally conveyed that I would like and a drink and she told me the total which was something under 20$. I made it to the window after a long wait for only two cars 
And the employee has this hostile demeanor. I decided I didnt want my card vanishing through the bulletproof glass and handed her the last money, two tens and a one.  As soon as the glass slammed again I realized my error, now frantic because my flight was to depart soon. The window opened and she shoves the bag at me as if it were on fire and I said ""I overpaid"" and she responded ""yes, you did!"" Sneered and slammed the glass. Now im holding a bag of food I am worried about eating because of her attitude and am really eager to throw the food into a suitcase and get on the plane. 
I am not anti Midwestern, I grew up near STL. Maybe this employee was having a really bad day. This isn't even about the dollar she stole, it's principle.

They didn't have it all along my ticket that should've been taken to the back was sitting pretty lonely on the counter by the register. So a nice lady I assume management comes over and apologizes and mentions they will give me an extra crab cluster for my wait. At this point I'm pissed but I believe in karma so I waited an additional 5 mins (oh I ordered online between 755-807 and didn't leave the place until after 9) and so I walked to the counter and asked for a refund she then screamed to the back for them to get my order up next wish this was the energy after you seen me waiting here for an hour but whatever. So she comes around the counter again to inform me they don't do refunds even though this was not my fault she offered me a free meal not of equal value but she offered a free meal to come back in to receive. My suggestion is to just dine in or order when you get there. My wife loves seafood so if this would've went differently we would've been there at least once a month and a few pick ups in between.

In fact, this might be the best quick Chinese place I've been to in all of St. Louis County and I'll tell you why - Usually Chinese places like this give you some kind of bulk prepared fried rice with your lunch entree, and if you order the actual fried rice entree off the menu it's usually better quality. This place actually does each individual's portion of fried rice for the lunch combo made to order, so it's fresh and it's actually the good stuff with bean sprouts, etc. I love good fried rice so I really appreciate that.

Since they've opened (I've come here at least once a week) they've actually REDUCED their price which is unheard of. Where can you get an appetizer and lunch cobmo of this quality for $4.95 after tax? Sheeeeit.

The best part about this place is the quality though, everything is freshly made to order and the egg rolls are very good (I'm not a fake crab rangoon fan so I don't know how those are). 

I recommend the Kung Pao Chicken.

The owners/employees are very friendly too.

ZHXKyqOCfKJ43vxfbhLgOw,DesdS3JFnf2eHfJd7qAiPw,PbLOYYF-qoENx6Cy2zLK7w,3,1,0,0,"China King is a dine-in or takeout joint in the Buzz Westfall Plaza on the Boulevard (aka the former Northland Plaza), located at the site of the former Chopstix.

I don't know if China King is a chain, or just a very popular generic name for a Chinese food restaurant.

As a frequent Chopstix diner, I was anxious to try this particular China King so I could see how it compared, and how it was overall.

For my family, I ordered the Singapore Noodles, Seafood Delight, Fried Steamed Dumpling (eh, basically potstickers), Special Fried Rice, Eggrolls, Fried Chicken Gizzards and Hot Braised Wings, to go.

The dining area is just ok. It is quite small, and I have never cared for the windows being uncovered. The decor is nothing special, but decent. It looks clean, and it's still better than the often dilapidated seating at the typical ""city"" Chinese (primarily) take-out restaurants. I was there in early evening, and there were other take-out customers, but no one dining in at that time.

The dumplings may very well be made in-house, and are shaped a little differently from typical potstickers, but were good, and come with the usual vinegar & soy sauce mixture.

Eggrolls were good, possibly better than average. I don't know if they are made there or are provided by a vendor.

The gizzards had a great flavor and were simply seasoned. Very lightly breaded. 

The Singapore Noodles was quite good! This is made with spaghetti-like noodles, and contains a bit of curry in the sauce. 

The fried rice was very good, and rightfully so, as many Chinese joints in or near the city simply must be good at fried rice! China King did well here.

I forgot to try the wings, but mama said they were good.

Now, I might've given them another star had their Seafood Delight been on-point, however, it wasn't quite there. When you serve dishes like this, you simply must make sure each of the many ingredients is as fresh as possible, from the start. While the dishes were prepared with skill, some of the seafood items were... dicey. The shrimp was super chewy and just not the correct snappy texture one would expect. The surimi (sea legs, imitation crab) looked good, but tasted off.

They threw in a few crab rangoon, since I had gotten so much food! They were good, a bit sweet, no noticeable crab, but then that's common with these things.

The bottom line, is that this China King is a winner, and is much better than most any Chinese restaurant in the North County area. You will not find food this good at Lisa's or anything else nearby. 

Generally, recommended!",2016-03-30 01:38:11

We ordered the plain fried rice w/ bean sprouts and green peppers, crab Rangoon, and a plain St. Paul. The fried rice was pretty good. I added my usual hot pepper and soy sauce to it. The crab Rangoon was a little bit too sweet for my taste but was fried perfectly so I had no problems eating it. Now the St. Paul was mediocre at best. A St. Paul is basically a fried egg patty sandwiched between two pieces of white bread. The sandwich usually comes with mayo picked and onions. I asked them to hold the mayo and I assumed it would have the pickles and onions on it. Well it had an unmelted cheese slice a tomato and a piece of lettuce. The patty was not thick.

A St. Paul sandwich with American cheese?  That was a surprise. The cheese slice didn't pair well with the so-so egg foo yung patty. The fried patty outside lacked outside crispness. I regretted that, though it meant the thin patty wasn't overcooked inside. 

Mayo was applied as a blob rather than spread on the bread. Lettuce was a curled piece that covered the dressing instead of  the sandwich. It wasn't a bad sandwich but not very interesting either.

I have never had Chinese food come out so quickly or be so fresh when it arrived.  It wasn't greasy, was loaded (I mean, LOADED) with veggies, and the servings were plentiful and filled with flavor.  YUM!

They have an array of specialty dishes that you don't see often on many menus, but plenty of the old classics you always yearn for at a Chinese Restaurant as well.  The peking duck is apparently a specialty, I wouldn't know, I haven't had it, but my sister did and said it was amazing.  They slow roast all their meat, so if you are a meat eater, I am sure this is stuff that will just melt in your mouth.  

I can't say I make it to Jennings often, but next time I do, if I am hungry I am certainly stopping in here.  I might even make the drive just to get this veggie loaded deliciousness on my own.",2008-10-15 20:21:50

(Which, incidentally...Pei Wei's is the poor man's PF Changs, but I digress.)  I work up north, and there isn't much to eat up here except fast food, super greasy Chinese food, or a Schnuck's salad.  That is why Chopstix is so welcome.

Sure, the dining area is a bit small, but who cares.  The people are SUPER friendly, happy, nice, excited you are there, etc.  The food - just perfect.  For lunch, I'm not looking for a big ol' meal that will make me drowsy in 20 minutes.  Nope - I'm just looking for something quick and easy that won't clog my arteries.  Thank you, Chopstix, for providing that.

Their menu has all the basic Asian fare and you can customize it with brown rice, extra veggies, less oil, more oil, whatever.  If you get the combo, you can satisfy your taste buds with an egg roll or a couple crag rangoons which are medium-sized but just big enough to whet your appetite.

My only complaint is that it is a smidge over-priced.  Not by a lot; maybe just a buck or so.  But, still, compared to what I have up here, it is a fantastic option.",2010-05-13 13:15:29
