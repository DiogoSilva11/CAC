I paid and she put my money on the counter and moved her head to look behind me to ask the lady she is ready. So I sat and watched her take the next lady and her money. Well she thanked her for business and gave her money in her hand bottom line. So now I can say it's a racist business!!!!! I watched them greet everyone and thank them for their business. BUT ME. They won't get another dollar from me or anyone I know.,2017-01-14 21:09:51

I ordered the Spicy Basil Fried Rice (peppers, onion, string beans, chili & egg) with chicken, which is enough for 2 people. The dish is medium spicy, but plenty hot for the average palate. Chicken was plentiful in the take out dish.

I like that you have a choice of chicken, tofu, ground beef, pork or steak for all of their entrees. Another good thing to mention is that they provide a few gluten-free alternatives as well as vegetarian options.

My husband and I used Preferred Party Rentals for our backyard reception in early August. We didn't really waste too much time after getting engaged (February) to tie the knot, so planning was a little hectic, to say the least. 
From the beginning, every single person I spoke to at PPR was courteous, helpful and accommodating. Initially, I placed my order with Mike and even made a few changes over email with him as well, which was wonderful. I even had a mini panic attack, the day before, over having a tent. (Early August being very hot, I had hesitation about having a tent at all as we were trying to save as much money as possible...My mother in law, being the voice of reason, told me that the tent was already cleaned and ready to go, so it went up and saved us from the showers we had the morning of the reception) I felt so silly about it later.
My mother in law had also spoken to them a few times to add items to our order and commented on how pleasant they were to work with and how easily they went over the order with her and made changes. 
Preferred Party Rentals is wonderful and I would absolutely work with them again...
...minus the breakdown. :)",2012-12-06 14:34:08

My steak was perfectly grilled just the way I requested (medium) and ribs were decent.  As always our meal was enjoyable.

First, the good stuff: Service is always AWESOME. The kids working in there are just so happy to be there, it's frightening. And so knowledgeable about the menu and meat in general. Bravo. I almost feel like they may be a little overstaffed, but that's probably because they are new and just hired a million people to start out with. 

The food is seriously delish, but if you don't like meat, seriously, you have no business here. I'm not a huge steak person, but I do okay with their steak tips dinner, which is very mushroomy and delicious. They also have amazingly good ribs, and the pulled pork is awesome. If clogged arteries are your thing, the cactus blossom is yum as well (think Chili's Awesome Blossom, or Outback's Bloomin' Onion - same exact thing). I think the best part is the bread they serve in the beginning, with the cinnamon-y butter. Dessert before dinner. SO GOOD! 

On the downside, it's a little pricey. Comparable to Outback or Lonestar, I suppose. But it's steak, so that's to be expected. 

Now on to my major complaint - wait time for a table. There's always AT LEAST a two hour wait, unless you go at noon on a sunday when everyone's still in bed/at church. The first time we went, we called ahead and were told to show up in about 2 hours to get our table (when you do call ahead, you're supposed to show up 15 minutes prior to your number being called). Once we got there, we had to wait an additional HOUR and 15 minutes. They said the problem was that people weren't leaving, that they were lingering too long for them to efficiently turn their tables, but it was still annoying. While we waited, waitresses were running up and down the waiting rooms (there are two huge waiting rooms on either side of the entrance, so I guess they knew they'd have a problem while building it) with appetizers for us to pick at, so that was thoughtful (and another testament to my theory that they're actually overstaffed). 

So, all in all, good chain restaurant as far as food and service. I just hope you can stand waiting. Don't even bother on a Friday or Saturday evening.",2009-05-28 18:09:04

Filet was cooked as ordered and  tasty, although I prefer a little more seasoning.  Pretty good quality beef, especially at their price point.  The side dishes were very good and well prepared. Service was exceptional. I don't usually like chains, especially steakhouses, but this was actually pretty good.  I recommend this place for a reasonably priced meal with excellent service.  The call ahead service needs improvement.",2012-07-19 13:55:24

the 'banana boat' was what i ordered since it was my first visit and thought this would be a good way to get the 'lay of the land' and try a sample of what the place offered.  the 'boat' arrived in the form of a square plate (someone posted a pic above).  immediately, i was unimpressed.  are you kdding me?! the sushi on this plate looked like the type you find at chinese buffets!  the shrimp over the rice ball and spicy tuna roll on here is the standard line-up at all the buffets!  ok. took a bite and it tastes about as good as it looked, meh.

so, if you want to eat meh overpriced sushi then go here or drive a little into the plaza and there is a chinese buffet that will serve you the exact same thing, except you'll only pay about a third of what they charge here.",2014-02-07 22:50:02

We decided to stop in on a Monday evening and my 5 yr old was really excited to do the hibachi. Unfortunately we were told there would be a 20 minute wait and were given a long explanation about only having two cooks in and blah blah. I knew a 20 min wait probably meant 40, and with two small kids that wasn't ideal, so we sat at the regular tables. Needless to say the kids were disappointed. I watched a few more groups come in for hibachi who had to sit on the regular side because of the wait. Which, 10 mins after we sat down, was still ""20 mins!""

The waitress was nice. We ordered beef dumplings for an appetizer. My 5 year old and husband were not fans. The waitress forgot my husbands wine but she was nowhere to be found after she took our order. We saw the wine sitting on the bar for a long time. The host, I believe, would bring us our soups and salads but then would run away so quickly we could barely ask him for the things we needed. 

I got filet and chicken with fried rice. I was pretty impressed and thought the food tasted great with a nice presentation on the plate. The rest of the meal went well until we got the bill. Very pricey! But the kicker was....$4 for a tiny plastic kids cup of apple juice??!?!? I thought I was seeing things. My husbands wine was only $2 more! Wow. 

Still undecided about this place. I think I will give the hibachi side a try soon, but will definitely call ahead first!!!",2014-04-22 01:28:27

zhTy6rrxBm7i0axB6yZwgA,-kAQ-PSKx3i0st2B4aPpTg,rnioJAG4aQp2TJHUxLy7CQ,5,0,0,1,"Admittedly, I think of take out joints as less than ""real"" restaurants. In Pikpon's defense, they do have four tables, but it is primarily a take out. 

Pikpon has totally obliterated my feelings on take out places. Their food is excellent, not greasy and not salty. My fingers did not swell to the size of grapefruits like they do after nearly all other take outs--primarily Chinese and including pizza places.

We ordered the Chicken and Shrimp Shu Mai (steamed), Tom Yum Soup, Chicken Pad Thai, and Red Curry with Tofu. Nothing let us down. The Shu Mai was simultaneously dense and delicate, with a sauce that rivals any other dumpling sauce I've had. The Tom Yum Soup had the most potent of lemongrass, giving it an excellent Spring-like flavor. 

My partner cannot eat spicy food, so the Chicken Pad Thai was perfect. The noodles were done perfectly and the seasoning was perfect--you could really taste the crushed peanuts. We will be headed to Thailand later this year and I'm sure he will order this dish every chance he gets. 

My Tofu Red Curry was just the right level of heat, without burning your throat (or anything else)...just a nice spice in your mouth. The sauce was not really creamy, but nonetheless it could not have tasted any better. What was impressive was the firm and browned tofu. If I could make tofu like this, I'd probably make the leap to vegetarian because it was every bit as good--if not better--than any chicken dish I've ever had. What I also found best was it is not noodle based but bamboo shoots taking their place. I remarked to my partner that I could see using these as a vehicle for spaghetti gravy. So it was great to have such a tasty dish without the carb overload.

One of the reasons I consider take out subpar is because the texture changes in the take out containers. I'm unsure as to why we did not have this problem with Pikpon. I would say in my case, it could be because of the bamboo shoots replacing the noodles, but the Pad Thai had noodles and they did not become altered by the containers.

Thankfully, Pikpon is local to our residence. I can see becoming a regular visit here since the price is quite reasonable for the elevated level of their food. I had stopped eating Chinese food a while ago (mainly for health purposes), but I've missed it. Now I have a far superior alternative to that.",2018-05-21 12:42:51

So why 2 stars?  I asked to put $60 on my card for my portion of the check, as the people I was there with were paying their portion with their own card. This simple request ended with me have 3 charges for $59.99, $63.23, and $60.00 on my card. I was told they messed up and voided 2 of the 3 charges. If you see my Tun Tavern review from years back, the same thing happened to me then! Do I have really bad luck on this or what?! 

You HAVE to be more careful with people's money! When I hand my card to a waiter/waitress to pay for food or services, I expect ONLY the amount billed to be charged. This hold is now a 5-7 day inconvenience where that money is unavailable. Luckily I don't need the money immediately, but this is $120 less that many people might not be able to have put on hold for upwards of a week. 

So go for the food and atmosphere - but I recommend standing over the register as they run your card or at the least mentioning that you expect them to not charge and void your card, AT ALL.",2015-11-08 02:23:29

First off, the service here was amazing. Everyone was very friendly, knowledgeable and cheerful. The rolls they bake fresh are very delicious (although I didn't particularly care for the cinnamon flavored butter). They also have roasted peanuts at every table (and also two very large barrel-fulls of the roasted peanuts at the entrance/waiting area). My parents really loved the peanuts and couldn't stop eating them.

The price was really quite reasonable since most of the dishes come with two sides. We ordered a full rack of ribs and side orders of mashed potatoes and steak fries.  The ribs were literally falling-off-the-bone  delicious. The flavor and texture of the meat and BBQ sauce was among the best I've had in a while. The quantity of the mashed potatoes was a bit disappointing since the size was the equivalent of a large spoonful in a small dish. Also, the steak fries were only average, although they were well seasoned. It would have been much better if it little was a little more crispy on the outside. 

We also ordered the grilled salmon with a side of Caesar salad and a sweet potato. The salad was very fresh and well flavored. The croutons were super yummy, although it didn't feel like they gave us enough (either that or they were just that good). The sweet potato was also very well steamed and flavorful. The only complaint is that the salmon smelled... well... fishy (not in a good way). The taste was also a little off... and definitely did not mix well with the ribs. We ended up eating only a few bits of the salmon, and thought we'd let the manager know about the potential problem with the freshness of the fish.

We asked the server if we could speak to the manager (and she immediately went to get him for us). We explained the problem and the manager immediately offered to get us another dish or to take the grilled salmon off our bill. I was very impressed with the professionalism of his manner and actions and would definitely go back (although I would probably still avoid ordering the salmon).

I strongly recommend going to this place for the ribs (and the freshly cut steaks seemed yummy too!).",2009-06-22 17:32:29

That being said, if i said the food was bad that would be an understatement. Not one person out of our party had anything good to say about their food. My whole family had stomach pains immediately upon getting home. I had a bacon cheeseburger and the bacon was so salty it was inedible. The burger although it was cold had been cooked extremely well and was very dry.  My sisters strip steak had a ton of fat and sinew running through it. 

I woke up in the middle of the night after eating here with extreme stomach pains, after throwing up for quite some time i felt a little better. Its pretty clear i had food poisoning and if i had saved any of that terrible burger i prob would have taken it somewhere to have it tested. 

Ive had a better meal at mcdonalds, i will never go back to any texas roadhouse. I dont know if there is any quality control or if its just a terrible cook that is putting out slop, hopefully there isnt someone purposely making people sick there. I urge people to think twice before coming here.",2015-08-01 15:10:52

Problems - 3-4 employees ""hanging out"" at the hostess stand while on a 30 minute wait.  leaning on the stand and showing no sense of urgency.  Tables not cleared and then when cleared, no one getting people sat.  Tables left unsat for more than 15 minutes.  Manager hanging out with friends at the bar and not doing anything to help.  About 20 minutes to get food.  Hamburger came out and was dry and not edible.  Then ordered a grilled cheese for my son and the cheese was burnt black.  Because the manager showed no effort, the staff, except for Angela, also showed no concern.  Will never go back.  There are to many places to go.  If you look at all the reviews, too many low stars.

You get seated and they bring you some pretty good buttered up bread with cinnamon butter to spread. It's nice and warm and soft and delicious.

The butcher will then give you a ticket, which you will then give to your server and tell them how you would like your steak done. 

The ribeye and sirloin were the most popular cuts of steak, so I went ahead and settled for 20-ouncer done medium-rare. We also went ahead and ordered numerous appetizers such as the fried pickles, cactus blossom and potato wedges with cheese and bacon bits. The cactus blossom was interesting and had a nice crunch to it and went well with the dipping sauce that they provided. My steak was seasoned well and went well with their signature steak sauce. 

Overall, I had a wonderful first experience here at Texas Roadhouse. The service was impeccable and the food got my party and I more than satisfied. I will definitely be dining at Texas Roadhouse again in the near future! $40 per person for a decent steak dinner along with drinks and appetizers is extremely economically friendly.",2018-03-29 02:42:53

Now they've gotten far too big for their britches.  Their soup is a prime example of their outrageous prices, they want $3.49 for a really small sized ""medium"".  Their medium soup is like maybe 5 ounces.  Their ""large"" size is $4.49 and it's literally almost the exact same size as the medium, maybe half an ounce larger at most. What the heck is with that price?!  For soup!?  And, Wawa, don't for a minute think I didn't notice the fact that you reduced the size of your soup containers to HALF what they used to be!  I still have one of the older soup containers they used to use (a large) that I cleaned out and use to hold stuff in, I compared it side by side to the size of one of their newer ""large"" size soup containers, and it's hilarious how much smaller the new ""large"" size soups are compared to their old ones.   Their old large containers were closer to what is now considered ""family"" size.  And they charged around the same price that they now charge for ""medium"" soups.  That wasn't even all that long ago either, I think maybe 3 or so years ago was when they made the size changes. 


Classics are more expensive too, which is odd considering you can get a $5 sub from Subway which is 2 inches larger than their classic and costs less.  I used to love Wawa SO much, what happened to them!!?  Quality has gone down, prices have gone up, and menu items that I used to LOVE are not on the menu anymore.  There are many better places in the area now, so Wawa gets visited only when literally NOTHING else is open and I have to bite the bullet and pay for overpriced poor quality food from here because i'm hungry and it's 3 AM. you broke my heart, Wawa.

I had to call my wife in the middle of ordering and ask if she wanted chicken instead. (I should have just walked out at that point because what I'm about to say is disgusting). After my order was complete, a second employee walked out from the back sweating profusely, rosey cheeked, smelled like a farm animal. I don't even want to think about what she was doing in the back the whole time that this other employee was working on cleaning cooking and checking people out at the cash register. (The 3rd employee never surfaced). She literally threw the cup for my queso towards the other girl when I added it to my order and had such a nasty attitude with her. I wish there was a way to contact the owner because this was one of our favorite spots for a quick burrito fix and I doubt the owner knows that these slobs are running it into the ground.",2017-07-01 22:25:30

I was on vacation near LBI and discovered Liscio's bread products at my local ACME in Barnegat. I am very picky about my bread, I don't eat a lot of bread but I will indulge when it is very good and with good butter on hand. So as soon as I spotted the delightful SNOWFLAKE ROLL in the bakery case with all that cute powdered flour on top of a lovely bouncy poofy roll, I knew this would be good. 
I came home sliced in half and buttered it up, put in micro for 10 seconds and voila. Best roll I ever had in my life and I lived in France:)  It was all about texture and melt in your mouth goodness. 

I will be now hunting for wholesale Liscio products from now on in this area. I hope they do very well.

My SO and I get there for hibachi and are the first seated at a new table. They place us at the right end. Never the best spot to sit. But it's okay. We've sat here before. Then three other sets of two are seated. The chef comes out and says his hello's and says ""oh hey, you're back again. You're a good man"" and immediately you wonder what this means for food portioning. 

My boyfriend orders the $2 extra for extra fried rice (since sitting at the right end always means you get less) and he is the only one that does so at this table. I order chicken. And only one other person orders chicken (with their steak). 

The fried rice starts being served out and I am the last one served. I received half as much as everyone else. Then he gives the ""favorite"" guy more. Then my boyfriend his ""extra"" and then more on 3 other people's plates. And then a third serving to the favorite guy. He had more rice on his plate than my boyfriend who paid for extra . I never got a second serving. So I have half as much as the usual and we paid extra so someone else could have three times as much as everyone else. 

When the chicken was done he served the steak and chicken plate his portion. Then my plate my chicken. Had extra left still. And instead if giving to the people who paid for it, HE GIVES IT TO THE FAVORITE GUY WHO DIDNT EVEN ORDER CHICKEN! 

How is this fair? I understand servings aren't exact in hibachi but when you so blatantly favorite one person in that way, it puts a bad taste in everyone else's mouth. Needless to say, we will never come here again because we refuse to pay for other people's food.",2015-04-13 00:07:46

Why she didn't just take them all out in the first place, instead of spraying them with toxic cleaner, I will never know.

Got the ribs again this time. Was not as tender everywhere, unlike last time, but about 1/3rd of the ribs were still super tender while the rest were just mediocre. That being said, the BBQ sauce is still delicious.

We avoided the salmon this time (given what happened last time I visited) and instead ordered a prime rib (medium rare) and a NY strip steak. The server had told us that Texas Roadhouse was FAMOUS for its steaks, cut fresh everyday. The prime rib was very tender, although lacking in that strong meat flavor normally associated with slow-cooked food. Sadly, the Au Jus that came with it had a STRONG vegetable flavor and no meat flavors at all, a disappointing complement to what would have been a great prime rib.

The steak was the worst disappointment. We ordered it medium rare and it came out medium well. The server was no where to be found, and only stopped by after about 1/2 the steak had been cut and shared. Wasn't worth the trouble at that point, but a big disappointment given the hype about the steak when we arrived. 

Overall, still a good place for going out, but I will just have to keep trying different menu items until I find one that is consistently good.",2009-07-09 16:58:01

I'm currently losing weight (45 pounds down) and a client told me about this new cafe. I was so excited that it was so close to my job that way I could run in on my break. I walked in on a rainy day, it was dead which is normal for bad weather. I looked at the menu options (about 5 wraps & 5 salads to choose from) after reading the menu I was actually turned off by what was listed. I was pretty surprised a place that serves salads and wraps had no chicken Cesar wrap. As I wanted to leave because I didn't like anything the woman approached me with help. I felt awkward to leave so I decided to order a chicken salad wrap. She asked me what type of wrap and proceeded to make my order. She went into the back to get the ""chicken"". As she left I looked down at their ""ingredients"" and nothing looked appetizing. I was confused since it was 12:30 in the afternoon why it --- 1. Wasn't busy & 2. Lunch time why wasn't anything out? I looked at the chicken salad and almost gagged. The salad had a brownish color and looked like it was made a week ago. The chicken looked dry and was made days ago. I immediately started to panic because I wanted to tell the woman please stop with my order but felt embarrassed to just walk out. Let's just say this, every product she took out had a ""shop rite"" logo on it. None of the chesses that are ""fresh"" were freshly grated. It literally came out of a shop rite package. They have about 5 salad dressings that ALSO were shop rite labeled! I literally almost died of embarrassment. How are you claiming all your products are fresh when they are coming from a shop rite container? Not to mention the photos on your website are grilled pieces of chicken! You are serving someone shredded dry chicken from a rotisserie chicken! That I'm sure you bought a couple days ago. Extremely disappointed and I will never return. Save your time, money and stomach and go down the road to Panera. I'd rather pay 2x the price for actual fresh ingredients. Also the wrap tasted terrible.

In the case of Pikpon Thai, I don't think I could really emphasize enough how incredible this place is. As somewhat of a connoisseur of Asian cuisine, I have become extremely selective of where I bring my business because I have exposed myself to many fine dining establishments. This is a blessing and a curse considering it has made me a much more fastidious eater especially in the realm of Asian cuisine. That being said, Pikpon Thai is your very own slice of Thailand and leaves virtually nothing be desired if you are on the hunt for incredible food, heartfelt staff, and a serene atmosphere. My first visit to Pikpon Thai felt like my hundredth, I was greeted with warmth and appreciation as if I were part of the family. Once seated, I noticed several avant-garde items on the menu and before I could inquire my server walked me through some of the more popular dishes and asked me questions to help decipher what might be ideal for me. I asked about a drink they serve called ""Nom-Yen"", a creamy pink smoothie reminiscent of bubblegum. I wasn't sure if I wanted to give it a try yet, but I gave her my entree order. Shortly after she returns with a plethora of condiments and explained the difference between the few and advised which ones would work well with my dish. Already highly satisfied with my experience, she returns moments later with a beautifully decorated (eight ounce) sample of this deliciously trendy pink drink. She stood in front of me awaiting the reaction of my first sip and when she saw that I enjoyed it, her eyes lit up in gratitude.  This was especially potent to me because it was a true testament to the passion that goes into their cuisine, heightening my excitement and anticipation for my entree. I ordered what I believe is called ""Nom Tok Neua"", which is similar to Pho, but far more savory, soulful, and customizable. As I waited, I admired the beautifully tranquil and neo-traditional   decor contrary to the typical Thai restaurant mugginess. The Pikpon soundtrack is anything but boring or dry, they play stuff like lofi hip-hop and soft-house that bring a fun and modern vibe to pair perfectly with the colorful, energetic aura of the dining room. When my food arrived it was aesthetically nothing short of spectacular; I'm not the Snapchat eats first type of dude, but this was justified. Anyway, I'm sure you can guess what came next. If you guessed mouthgasm, you are correct! An explosion of hearty protein and spices with the soothing balance of warm broth and vibrant greens. I got a 5-star dining experience for less than $20 and that isn't the only reason I keep coming back. I come here because this restaurant is comprised of genuine, caring, passionate, and talented folks who deserve nothing less than success in an overly saturated industry where the passion and compassion are few and far between. This review couldn't possibly help you conceptualize the experiences I have had at Pikpon Thai, I implore you to give this place a shot. Even if you aren't a huge fan of Asian cuisine they will tailor a dish around your preference, you just have to ask! Trust me, you will NOT be disappointed.",2018-10-01 22:53:42

I've been to many, east coast, west coast, and in between.  It's a nice staple of travelers where one can get a decent meal, decent service at a decent price.  Consistency is what is required from a chain to succeed and to keep people coming back.

This one failed.

Family outing, 4 of us and we order variations of the same burger.  Some want it medium rare, others well done, some with fries, and others with onion rings.

Here's where the problem starts.  The person who takes the order out is not the person who brings it.  So the mix up begins and people start eating food that is too rare, has the wrong condiments, etc.  Drinks are late, and the manager is called.

Basically we left with an unappetizing meal, a bad family outing which ruined the night and bewilderment at how difficult it is to follow some simple precepts:

1.  If you have similar orders, put a toothpick in a burger to denote the difference - such as rare, medium rare and well done.  
2.  If you have potential for confusion in an order, then don't offload the meal to someone who didn't serve the table and wouldn't know what is right and wrong with the order.
3.  If you're going to call the manager, don't have us explain the story a third time.  Brief him before he comes out so he doesn't wander into the line of fire of some unhappy ex-military folks.

I will give thumbs up towards rectifying the order by adjusting the final check but action beats reaction.  The mix up shouldn't have happened in the first place if some common sense guidelines were in place.",2012-02-26 20:44:51

This place is why I truly believe hole-in-a-wall spots are the best places to grab a bite. The restaurant is set up more like a take out than anything else. There are a few tables but mostly Pikpon was designed as a take out joint.

It was our first time here and I cannot resist but to get way more than we had the stomach for. Our waitress Aiko was very accommodating and extremely knowledgable of the menu. For appetizers, we got; deep fried spare ribs, steamed crab dumplings, larb with ground pork and Thai fish cakes. We also opted for the lunch special which came with a side of salad with thai peanut dressing and tom yum soup, the entree was Basil fried rice with chicken and I later ordered a bowl of stew noodles with beef. 

The salad came first and was easily the best way to start the meal. The salad mix was fresh and the peanut dressing sweet and delicious. It was gone the minute it hit the table. The larb came next and I was completely blown away. I am a huge fan of larb and it is very hard to find a place to make it authentically. Thankfully, Pikpon delivered in a big way. The fact that the chef was generous with the lime leaf in the salad got me extremely happy. The sauce was on point with the right amount of sweet and salty. Also, they didn't name this place Pikpon (pepper) for no reason, the larb had a strong kick to it. 

The basil fried rice had a lot of flavors, the dish was deceptively small looking as I kept eating but couldn't finish. You can taste all the ingredients here, you can tell it was freshly prepped. The fried rice was spicier than we had anticipated. Even though I didn't wanted to bother them since it was our fault for picking the spice level, the chef insisted on remaking our dish for us free of charge. Talk about excellent customer service!

The spare rib appetizer was crunchy and salty, the steamed crab dumplings were soft and delicate, contrasting the crisp texture of the ribs. I was pleasantly surprised with how flavorful the beef stew noodles was. I was glad they left out pigs's blood from the broth unless requested by more adventurous diner. The authentic version of this is called Boat noodles and they are always served with pig's blood. I was glad to not have it, I don't really like the irony after taste.

We ended the meal with Thai taro custard and pandan custard served with steamed bread for dipping. I checked in and got a free Thai iced tea, the restaurant also treated us to 2 free thai coffee after dinner. The taro pudding was an instant hit, it was a cross of an egg quiesce and a flan texturally and had chunks of taro throughout. The pandan pudding had a very creamy texture, it was definitely everything I wanted in a custard. The steamed bread soaked up all the custardy goodness. It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal. 

Awesome food, amazing service: shout out to Aiko and the talented chef Tommy for an amazing experience. I will be coming back with many many people!!",2017-12-13 16:04:26

This style restaurant seems to be coming into fashion on the East Coast, although it is more played out on the Left Coast. 

This one is apparently under new management, and they are attempting to make the facility more comfortable and attractive.  They have done a good job on the creature comforts, and the service is also attentive, except for the minor language difficulties in understanding each other through the Korean and South Jerzee accents.  

I was the guest this night, and my hostess did all the ordering.  I opted for the sushi side of the joint, although the Hibachi room was more active and colorful, especially when they performed their volcano show with the ball of fire shooting into the air.  Luckily, we could see that from the safe distance on the far side of the room.  

The Clear Soup was quite good as part of the dinner package.  The Sashimi platter (Deluxe?) was ample with a nice variety of well sliced fresh fish.  They all had good taste, but I would have preferred them slightly cooler.  I tasted all the offerings, but was not feeling compelled to finish them.  The Rolls (Sorry. The names were not disclosed to me) were okay, but not exciting.  Typical sushi rolls, but why the chef put cream cheese in it is beyond me.  Do they even have that in Japan?  This is not something I would consider ordering on my own.  Maybe this is what is popular in this part of South Jersey, or because it is close to Philly, cream cheese is a concession to local culture. Fish and cream cheese? No. Thank you!

I was happy to have dinner with a friend, and content to let her treat in return for something I handled for her.  Still, something more authentically Japanese would tempt me more than this Korean version of an Americanized Japanese Hibachi/Sushi store.  It just didn't hang together for me.",2015-06-04 19:07:03

I had a fillet the other week at a different restaurant, but this sirloin tasted better. I got the A1 sauce to go with the meal. Bottom line, the food here is very good! 

Conclusion-I got no desert this trip, however, I did get their alcoholic drink called the hurricane which includes Captain Morgan & a mixture of fruit & I think vodka. Hit the spot! If you ever get a chance to visit a Texas Road House, I recommend it. Also, if it's your birthday, you get to ride the sattle. Yeehaw!",2019-05-23 02:33:38

My daughter had the wonton soup and steamed dumplings. She said the dumplings were VERY good, and the wonton soup was good (notice the missing modifier ""very""). 

I had the chicken & broccoli combo with pork fried rice and an egg roll. The egg roll did  not have a lot of stuffing, but was very crispy. This is how I like my egg rolls, so if you have similar taste, this is a plus. If not, it will be a fail for you. The pork fried rice was one of the best that I've had. The combo serving size was very large and enough for two days.

The problem is with the chicken & broccoli, specifically, the chicken. Although the taste of the dish itself was one of the better ones I've had in my 57 years, there was something grossly wrong with the chicken texture. It was as if a bit of water was injected into each piece, perhaps like a poorly executed processed chicken, only you can tell it's not processed. The pieces that were not like this were too rubbery and dry to chew and had to be discarded. Honestly, I have not ever encountered texture like this and I would be hesitant to order this again.

The price was very reasonable, but the only accompaniments were a small bag of noodles. No soy sauce. No hot mustard. No duck sauce. No tea. No fortune cookies. 

Because everything (minus the chicken) tasted so good, I'm willing to try this restaurant again.  If I get passed my hesitation with the chicken, maybe I'll give that a second try, but if it's like that again, I would knock this restaurant down to one star. I don't care how good the rest of a meal tastes, chicken needs to ""chew"" like chicken...I know what y'all are thinking, and I don't think it's anything but chicken, but this is enough to wreck it for me.",2018-12-19 16:29:06

My pedicure water was cold and I asked for hot water to be added and she only added another a cup of hot water, which did nothing. She didn't ask me my name, if it was my first time there, how I was, or what shape I wanted my toe nails. I know she understood English cause I wanted to change my color selection and she helped me pick out a color. 

I can guarantee that the equipment used for the pedicures aren't sanitized at all. The toe brush, heel scrubber, and the grater for your heels were all just sitting in the drawer when she used them on me and then just simply put back. Any other salon I go to puts those materials to the side after use and then they take it to the back with the other dirty objects. 

The lady who wrapped my toes in foil, gave the pedicure, and painted my toes were different. After a layer of polish was painted on my toes, I saw that they were all mismatched regarding the shape. When I pointed this out, the third lady asked me why I didn't say anything sooner. I was besides myself and replied that I couldn't see the shape of an unpainted toenail. 

None of the three women were welcoming and the third lady was busy answering calls on her cellphone from geico and texting other clients about available appointments. The third lady was my nail tech and was texting other clients instead of paying attention to the person in front of her. 

After my 20 minute manicure and 1.5 hr pedicure, I left and wasn't even offered a card to their reward program. They probably knew I wouldn't be back.

I've worked with Mike and his team twice now and both experiences have been filled with quick, efficient, and personable service.

For an upcoming event, Mike came out to the site, measured all the rooms and is in the process of entering the info into a program that creates a basic blueprint of the venue. He's figuring out where all the tables are to be situated, he's helped me visualize where the vendors should go, and even offered to deliver and pick up the tables, chairs, linens, and other rental stuff during non-business hours. 

Being a one-woman operation, it's really wonderful to have someone like Mike on my side. He's taken a lot of stress off my shoulders and I gave him a muffin for that.",2010-02-27 01:01:28

DrjUdEy1sZjs1axUQ7h21A,gDTrJxYJteZSmu1FiHYCqg,rnioJAG4aQp2TJHUxLy7CQ,5,2,0,0,"Pikpon Thai is truly a hidden gem! My parents and I decided to try this restaurant in hopes of finding the best Thai restaurants around South Jersey, and now it ranks near the top of our list. Located by a dingy, run-down plaza, the exterior frankly seemed uninviting- but that is the case with all hole-in-the-walls, and because we saw such potential, we gave it a go.

From what I understand, most people come here for takeout given the small dining space, but dining in was really a pleasant experience. We were the only people dining in, with customers occasionally walking in and out to pick up their food, but service was fast to keep up us occupied with our meals. For appetizers we ordered the chicken satay which came out hot and fresh from the kitchen, pairing quite nicely with the smooth peanut sauce, which served as a kind of coolant to the chicken. And because I like cool-sounding drinks, I went for both the Thai iced milk tea and the Thai green soda, both of which I enjoyed very much. The taste of the green soda was reminiscent of bubble gum, though after drinking it I did a little research and found that it might have been cream soda. I loved them and hope to try the red soda and the nom yen next time!

I was especially impressed, though, with my main course, which was the green curry beef with rice. I honestly wasn't expecting much because a lot of the curry dishes I've had at other Thai restaurants around here tasted the same; however, this green curry beef had a lot of flavor. The sauce, having a coconut milk base, was smooth and packed a nice kick; rather than masking the flavor and textures of the beef and the mixed vegetables, the proportions of sauce and substance allowed for those aspects to be present. In other words: no overpowering spiciness, no mushy meat or veggies.

Dish presentation was nothing complicated or fancy, but it came out clean and picture-worthy. (For reference, I posted a picture of the food on my snapchat story and had several friends asking what restaurant I was eating at) Portion sizes for my entree and all our dishes were just right.

We concluded our meal with a delicious plate of mango with sticky rice (our go-to Thai dessert) drizzled with warm coconut milk and had a friendly conversation with the owners of the restaurant, who are fairly new to the area. Customer service overall was great and made the dining experience less intimidating even though it's the road not often taken.

There's just something about sitting down in a small family-owned restaurant and having the food served to you straight from the kitchen, rather than traveling with the food and stalling its freshness, that makes you more aware and appreciative of the authenticity and warmth that was put into cooking the food.

(just a heads-up: I don't believe I saw a customer bathroom inside, but the Wawa is next door so you can manage)

Hope to go back to try more of their food!",2019-07-26 04:00:46

For obvious reasons, grooming a cat is challenging and most groomers don't want to do it. Even PetSmart would turn over cat groomers so quickly we couldn't keep up. Dog Gone Stylin eliminates that. The prices are competitive to other groomers in Philly (where we'd end up taking her) and she comes straight to your home and takes care of everything in her van. No drop off/pick up, no worries that your animal is stressed out waiting for their turn/waiting for pickup, and you can take care of things around your home while it happens.

I'm a person who watches what I eat, tries to stay in shape, and also tries to maintain some semblance of a budget.

Texas Roadhouse makes all of the above possible. I always get the same thing: 6 oz sirloin. For $8.99, I get a steak cooked medium (and they never screw that up), side salad and side vegetables. I get all the peanuts my fingers can open, and all the decadent rolls my conscience permits.

There is no better deal in town than Texas Roadhouse.

I ordered the 10 ounce rib-eye medium rare, which came out grey and looking like something from Ponderosa. I hate sending food back, but this was inedible. To give credit where credit is due, they took back the offending steak and the manager brought out the new one quickly. This is the only reason for two stars rather than one.

On the next try it came out a bit more pink on the inside. When a steak is wafer-thin I would imagine it is difficult to grill it medium-rare in a very busy kitchen.

Then we ordered the 20oz w bone in Ribeye that included our loaded baked Sweet Potatoes and Seasoned Rice with Hot Rolls. The rice was very seasoned and was served in a side bowl, delicious! The Ribeye was a decent cut and cooked to order. The hot rolls were amazing with cinnamon butter. Great Sweet tea!
This is not a top notch steak restaurant, but it is a casual family type restaurant with above average menu. I felt the price was great for the amount of food given, generous portions

While placing my order today with the very pleasant older lady, I noticed that the young lady putting something in the fryer, dropped a few pieces of whatever she was cooking on the floor, she looked at me instantly...instead of picking it up, she continued to watch me to see if I was still watching her. I continued to watch because she was acting strange...the lady that was helping me, finished taking my order & I paid. I didn't want to make assumptions, so I waited & continued to watch while three people walked all around the food that fell on the floor.
The one young lady keep looking to see if I was looking and I was, because I felt something was up. Long & behold, the older lady picked up the food & placed it back in the container with the other uncooked food. The sad part about this is she did it while I was still there...no respect for her customer. This type of behavior makes me wonder what is done when no customers are there.
I politely told her that was not cool & I saw when the young lady dropped the food and I intentionally watched to see what they were going to do since they all just kept stepping over the food with they dirty sneakers & didn't pick it up immediately after it fell to put it in the trash. I wasn't loud or disrespectful but really disappointed & disgusted that she didn't value me as a customer enough to do the right thing & trash it...how much are you losing for just those couple of pieces that fell...you lost a $35.00 order & a customer because of your greediness. This is one of the reason why people get sick when eating out & wonder why. She should be grateful that she still have customers doing this pandemic.
I pray that the owner read this & never ever do this again...this is unhealthy and just plain nasty.",2021-02-04 12:37:27

The bloomin onion is delicious, crispy and full of flavor. Fried pickles are actually delicious. I was very hesitant but read that they were good so said why not try them. I was amazed. I know it's not hard to mess up a salad but their salads are always so fresh and full of toppings. They put egg, cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers and croutons that are delicious. Their salad dressings are also home made and great. The atmosphere is awesome. Definitely the typical roadhouse. Peanuts everywhere along with the shells all over the floors. Country music is played and every so often the staff will do a line dance through the walkways. They have a saddle you sit on for birthdays which is awesome!

SHO DAVE ... ok, SHO GUN you are hidden away and a complicated U-Turn for westbound drivers on the Black Horse Pike but you are worthy of whatever it takes to get to your location in this awkwardly positioned small shopping plaza.

My earliest thought association for Japanese restaurants is quality service that honors the customer.  After entering this truly spectacular sushi bar/restaurant and soaking in the lighting that perfectly illuminates the thoughtfully designed interior our waitress brings us moist towelettes to clear our hands with.  That is the beginning of a spectacular meal and the quality service only increased as the meal progressed.  The sushi chef greeted us and everyone smiled.  They wanted to know if we were happy ... they did all they could to make us happy.

I usually do not spend much time considering a restaurant's interior design although dining out is a complete sensual experience.  So, let me just say that the layout for Shogun deserves 5 stars.  The simplistic look is so perfect for a Japanese restaurant and the white that predominates is a perfect match to the multiple colors on the plates that are served.

Shogun offers diners a great selection of sushi and sashimi and for this meal I went for the TUNA MANGO TARTAR along with a simple YELLOWTAIL SCALLION ROLL to start the meal!  WOW did these two items deliver ... the TARTAR's presentation was truly ""eye candy"" that enticed the taste buds but at the same time you didn't want to take apart the chef's presentation.  It was colorful with perfectly diced mango and tuna showcasing the chef's knife skills and dedication to presentation.  The Yusu Sauce was a delicious partner and the thin strips of radish offset the tartar perfectly.  Did I mention how YUMMY this was?  The roll couldn't compete with its appetizer partner although the tuna was fresh and the quality of the sushi chef was evident even in this simple item.

But the STAR ... the SUPERSTAR ... the OH MY GOODNESS SUPERSTAR was my entree, the GRILLED CHILEAN SEA BASS in MISO SAUCE.  Friday's I have often sought out fish fries but on this evening the photo perfect presentation could only hint at this perfect fish.  This might be the best fish I have ever had at a restaurant ... it is definitely the best I have had in a very long time.  First, the presentation was awesome and the accompanying veggies made for a colorful contrast to the fish's miso sauce.  They were cooked perfected.  But the fish ... moist ... warm edging close to hot but flaky and tender ... oh sooo good!  I savored each bite.  The sauce was delicious the miso coming through but not taking away anything from the sea bass's delicate flavors.  My chopsticks tried to take very small pieces to insure that the fish lasted as long as possible ... I savored this meal and our waitress who kept checking to make sure we were happy said that if I liked the sea bass that I would really like the MISO BLACK COD with MISO SAUCE.  WOAH ... if I liked the sea bass?  I LOVED the SEA BASS, which means either that COD can't compete or I am really in for a treat when I return to SHOGUN.

The SHRIMP and SCALLOP HIBACHI was flavorful with more than enough shrimp and scallops.  The veggies and presentation were evidence again of a careful kitchen.

The meal was wrapped up with the classic sweet orange cut into pieces surrounded by some truly palate pleasing mochi. 

Leaving everyone said goodbye and thank you ... waitress, hostess, sushi chef ... my goodness it was a wonderful feeling and OH MY OH MY what a delicious meal.

Just remember ... let your GPS SHOW YOU the way because you don't want to miss SHO GUN and if you drive past it turn around so that you can enjoy the experience.

An added note, as we left it was clear that the staff knows many of the customers.  Obviously once you are shown the way to SHOGUN you know how to return.

I had reached out for a quote for an upcoming party and received our quoted contract which states in bold ""Quote valid for 30 days"". So, less than a week and a half after receiving that quote, I go back to lock in the supplies and pay for it. I am told that they could no longer take new delivery orders for the week of our event. I was also told that everything is based on availability, which is not stated anywhere on the contract or in the previous emails I had received. If I had known this extra bit of information, that time was of the essence and I didn't have 30 days, I would have acted quicker to lock the delivery in. I was falsely relieved thinking I had 30 days to decide when within less than a week and a half the delivery was no longer available. I think Preferred Party Place needs to do some rewording on their contract and emails as to not mislead their customers. Luckily I didn't wait until the last minute to do this so I had time to find another party supplier. TNT Rental quickly saved our party and TNT Rental was so much easier to work with.

What you'll get as you are seated: All you can eat peanuts!  Amazing soft yeasty bread rolls that come out hot and fresh from the oven every 5 minutes (ask for refills if you want) - those are plopped down within a few minutes of sitting.

It was a rainy, cold day, so I was a bit disappointed that the only hot drinks they could offer was coffee or tea.  On the plus side, I asked for lots of milk to go with my coffee, and they brought out half a cup full, LOL.

They do ask if you want toppings such as mushrooms on your steak. They don't mention upfront that it's a $2 upcharge, so buyer beware.

The meal came with two additional sides. Loved the cesar salad - generous serving that arrived shatteringly crisp and ice cold. Just plain and a couple of croutons, but  it ticked off ""eat your vegetables"" checklist for the day.  The other side I asked for was mashed potatoes. Loved it - creamy and served nice and hot and nice and buttery.

As for the steak itself, it was fine for under $20.  Was it the thickest and best slab of beef I've ever gotten? Nope, but for a pleasant dinner, it'll do, Pig, it'll do. Had plenty of leftovers too, so enough for 2 meals for sure.",2019-10-21 20:58:48

Food-wise, we ordered the onion ring appetizer, catfish entree (with buttered corn and mashed potatoes) and the pulled pork entree (with chili and  french fries). 

You get complimentary rolls and these rolls are delicious! They come out warm,, which is clutch! They come with this spread and, wow! I got so full off of those, that I barely ate my food.

The presentation of the onion ring appetizer was impressive and unique. Taste though, wasn't anything special.

The size of the catfish entree is on the underwhelming side. However, the side of buttered corn was flavorful - a hint of sweet with a hint of savory!

The pulled pork entree is worth trying! Lot of quantity too, so that's a plus! This is some tender and well-seasoned meat.",2020-08-20 01:54:06

Arriving a bit after 5, I had the place to myself. Well, unless you count all the take-out orders, and they do a pretty brisk business in that area.  But it didn't take away from the service.  

The hostess, who was also my server, seated me immediately and brought the hot tea I opted for when she told me they didn't have a liquor license so I couldn't get the hot sake I really wanted.

But no matter.

I started with a bowl of miso soup ($2 for a GENEROUS bowl), followed by edamame, then a trio of sashimi: three slices each of tuna, salmon and a white fish. Beautifully presented, and absolutely delicious!

The meal was topped off with a half a fresh orange sliced into quarters for ease of popping into one's mouth, or sharing if I'd been dining with someone else.

Passing on the rice (as I'm trying to cut down on carbs) and finishing the meal with fresh fruit made me feel smugly virtuous.

Bottom line: the food was beautifully presented and delicious, and the place was sparking clean. The only reason it didn't get five stars was the absence of sake or any other alcohol.

My son had really wanted a steak dinner and being difficult to get to stores and certain supplies during this Covid-19 Pandemic, he heard that This Texas Roadhouse was offering family dinner specials where they have curbside takeout wherein you can order from a limited menu family meal or order the steaks to cook yourself at home. 
Everything was on a first come first basis either thru an app or by calling the restaurant. It was confusing. 

Hubby got there before 3pm so she said the option of getting steaks to cook yourself wasn't an option so he called home to have us just order the family meal for 4 and he'd just wait in the parking lot for it to be brought out prepared. 

Well, they seal it up & put it in your car so when he brought it home, we were appalled. 

This was not a meal for 4. The 4 cooked steaks were the size of a McDonald's hamburger and were way overcooked!  The salad was one container which would only equal 2 small side salads & then a small container of French fries with a few rolls on the side. 

Ridiculous. So, we just let Anthony have it all and hubby, me & Catarina all had something from our freezer. 

Horrible. I didn't want to order from this place in the 1st place bc we tried this place a couple times a few years ago dining in & they ruined my steak then. 

So, it hasn't gotten better, especially now. 

I don't recommend this ""steak"" place.

As far as a Texas Roadhouse, this restaurant is extremely well managed based on the speed of the food and the staffing, you will more than likely have a nice meal while you are here!  Our server today was extremely professional and knowledgeable and was polite but at the same time made sure to try and sell the menu, her name is Diana, and displays all the characteristics of what you would want in a server.

My Date and I wanted dinner but didn't quite know exactly what we wanted to eat.  So we pulled up,  saw folks standing outside and almost drove away because neither of us wanted some exorbitant waiting time.  Nevertheless, we got out and discovered that those people were just hanging out after dinner.  

The atmosphere and decor reminded me of a farm,  ranch and honky tonk bar all wrapped up into one. Music playing (I'll explain later) We were greeted warmly upon walking in the door. She asked for we'd been before and told us about the fresh baked bread and asked if we wanted to pick or own steaks from their display case or order from the menu.. We decided to order from the menu. Mainly because I didn't want a steak and my date is a pescatarian (spellcheck) - only eats seafood. We were seated in a cool booth and perused the menu.  Ordered two Hurricane Margaritas with a José Cuervo ""kicker"" aka extra shot in a test tube (kinda like Fat Tuesday's on South Street minus the BS bottom of the barrel Liquor). The drink was amazing.  Being a licensed bartender, I can be a little picky when it comes to restaurant drinks because in my experience, they're rarely made well and damage your wallet for a drink that tastes like juice mixes and a spit of alcohol. However I found it a little odd that the margarita was made with rum instead of Tequila.. But it tasted great and honestly you really didn't need the extra shot. Servers totally upsell you that extra shot lol.. 

Date suggested the fried pickle chips.. I was in heaven.. I can't remember what the dipping sauce was but holy cow.. Awesome sauce!  The baked bread and cinnamon butter was just as nice. We ordered the fried catfish platters. Choice of two sides. I chose a Caesar salad and green beans. He ordered a Caesar salad and loaded mashed potatoes minus the bacon. 

Salads came first. He wanted more dressing on his. I didn't need extra but it was a very bland salad. The dressing seemed like it needed salt.. So I didn't finish it. He got to the bottom of his salad and found a French Fry in his.. We both kinda laughed and predicted what our server, Madison would say when approached about it.  He said she would be like ""Oh that's odd"", giggle and walk away.. When she came back,  that's exactly what she did minus walking away.  She said that salads and potatoes are situated basically right by each other and asked if he was upset about it.  We said no and just wanted to point it out to her.  

We asked for paper napkins and she said that she couldn't find them for most of the day so he asked for bar napkins. Those arrived five minutes later.  Food came out at a decent time. I hate when it takes too long or comes out too fast. Give me time to digest my appetizer first, then into the real deal. I don't want nine thousand plates of food on my table at the same time. But I digress. 

Let me just say,  this place serves the best fried catfish I've ever had in my life. Crispy, cornmeal batter, flaky fish and huge portions!!! Green beans were well seasoned wth plenty of bacon! And not bacon bits. Smoky bacon. Boom! 

So back to the music. The music was WAY TOO LOUD for a restaurant. A bar, cool. But not at dinner time.. Loud music causes people to talk louder which makes it sound like a bar or club rather than a restaurant. 

Other than that, I had a decent time. Will be back.",2015-09-07 16:34:20

However, the manager came over and started belittling the cashier saying he was counting the change incorrectly when he clearly wasn't even doing anything wrong. The cashier shut the drawer because he got distracted by the manager's obnoxious behavior, which was understandable. The manager sighed dramatically and opened the drawer back up for him, and the cashier gave us the correct change. I don't think that managers should be belittle their employees like this EVER, let alone in front of customers!! Otherwise it's always a great experience here.

If you haven't read my reviews before, let me start with that I'm Italian, originally from South Philly and I am super picky when it comes to food as I cook a lot (taught from both sides of my Italy born grandparents).  Bc I'm from South Philly, I say ""Gravy"" when it's homemade. To my family, sauce comes from a jar. Lol 

Anyway, while throwing their birthday parties, I always orderLiscios is awesome!  Their homemade bread/rolls are off the hook!  The rolls make a sandwich/hoagie. Every hoagie we've had, even their trays are stuffed with meat. They do not skimp!  

I recommend their Chicken Cutlet Italian w/Broccoli Rabe and ask them to add their bruschetta on it with oil, mayo & vinegar! It's my favorite!  Anthony gets it with sautéed spinach instead which is still yummy!

What I love is that they will always Customize. So, read their menu & make the changes u want. They are always happy to do so. 

Their pastries, especially their danish are absolutely amazing!  Both my kids fav is the cheese. 

Thru out the years, we've always gone in for their cookies, The yummy St Joseph's Cakes and danish. 

If we have company, we grab one of their yummy cakes from the display. 

Throwing the kids birthday party's when they were young, their sheet cakes with whatever u want on it with their ""whipped icing"" was always a hit. Once they got older, of course they wanted their ""Italian Rum Cake"". Always a hit with everyone. 

I can't say enough about their bruschetta pizza and their spinach Stromboli. Omg!

From my first phone call to my last (the day of, when my point of contact Kristin called just to make sure everything was going smoothly), the service I received was stellar. 

I made multiple changes to my order and Kristin handled it like a total professional, even though I was convinced she probably wanted to strangle me after my many additional requests. But hey, it was a learning experience for me and the next time will hopefully be a little more seamless with regards to the ordering process. 

PPR had everything I needed, from tables to linens to chairs to coolers to a helium tank and more. The delivery guys were fast and I didn't have to tell them twice where everything went; they were on it. 

My only misstep was sending an email a couple days before the event to request some additional chairs, when I should have just called. Somehow, the message was lost in translation and I didn't get the extra chairs. It wasn't a big deal, but in the future, I'll definitely be sure to call with any changes or add-ons.

I really enjoy Moe's food. I've been to many locations and continue to dine there to this day. However, this location is so far below the standard of every other Moe's it's just unacceptable. The food taste old and not fresh. The entire restaurant is not clean. The staff isn't rude but they sure are not friendly. Even their welcome to Moe's when you walk in sounds incredibly somber. 

I've been to this location a few times because it was close to my house. I always felt it was never as good as the other places for the reasons listed above. My friend and I were out and he wanted Moe's and this was the closest location so we ended up here, reluctantly. The food was so bad my friend actually asked for his money back. I ate around half of mine and didn't want the hassle so I just said to myself I'll never come here again. My friend, however barely ate his food because it wasn't edible. The manager gave him his money back without giving him a hard time. That and the fact that I like Moe's in general is why it's a 2 Star and not a 1.

So, I've never really been a lunch meat hoagie person.  

But My hubby decided to order hoagies for dinner the other night. 

He ordered my son The Chicken Cutlet Italian (with spinach option), Oil, mayo, vinegar plus tomatoes. For himself and our daughter, he ordered their Old World Italian as specified on their menu. 

For me, Hubby ordered me the Old World Italian without Cheese but with oil, mayo, vinegar, lettuce & onion and specified instead of tomato to ad their bruschetta. (Hubby knows what I like, esp if he wants me to eat a hoagie, lol)

All Hoagies were awesome except they did put cheese on mine. I peeled it off & Gave  it to my daughter, then added mayo. They should've put more bruschetta on it, as they did charge extra as well, but I have to say, the meat on the hoagie was phenomenal!  

The BREAD makes their Hoagies, so so so good!!!  And I rarely eat bread!  

I give 4 Stars only bc they didn't get our order right. If they did, I know it would've been 5 Stars plus.

experience.  We were hungry and excited so we arrived prior to the restaurant opening and we waited twenty minutes until it opened at 2 pm.  We were the first customers to arrive and the first customers to be seated at a hibachi table.  The table had ten chairs and we sat in the chairs facing the front of the grill.  The hostess advised us rudely that we needed to move to the side of the table just in case other customers arrive so she could fill up the table.  We moved over but we wondered why the restaurant would not be practicing ""social distancing"" because the chairs are very close.  We were served soup and salads and sodas.  About ten minutes after we arrived, ten customers were seated at a second hibachi table.  Only two hibachi tables had Customers in the entire restaurant.  Around 2:20 a hibachi chef started cooking at the table that arrived ten minutes after us.  At 2:30 pm our table still had no hibachi chef.  Our one and three year olds were hungry and getting inpatient.  We advised the hostess that we have been waiting for a hibachi chef for a half hour and we wanted to know what time someone would start cooking at out table.  We were shocked when we were told we had to wait until the chef was done cooking at the table that arrived after us and that likely the chef would not start cooking for us  until 3 pm.  This was very upsetting for us that we would need to wait an hour especially when we were the first and only customers at 2 pm when they opened.  We were not offered an apology nor an explanation except that the restaurant wants to fill the seats at the table.  This was a poor policy on a day when there were no other customers there for a hibachi table except for us and the second table.  Of course we left without service and still hungry.  Sakura in Sicklerville has poor customer service at the front door given by their rude hostess.  We will not return to this restaurant and we do not recommend going there.

if you pressed me to pick a place I'd pick Moe's. Its really close. And here's why:

Chipotle seems to have better burritos, they're meatier and more flavorful. That doesn't mean Moe's has a bad burrito. Moe's has a bigger selection, and they're cheaper, mostly due to the free chips with each burrito, since Chipotle charges extra for them. On the subject of chips, Moe's are much better than Chipotle's. I do not like the lime zest on Chipotle and I feel like I've gotten stale, old chips from them. The salsa is also free at Moe's. Another Moe's win for me is the drink selection. They feature a Coca-Cola Freestyle soda fountain with literally 100+ different flavors of sodas and other beverages (About 30 flavors of sparkling and non-sparkling water alone). 

Moe's also has a text-promotion / loyalty rewards program (type your phone number in at the register -- so easy!!). They also have foursqaure specials, today I was able to get a free large soda with my burrito with it. Your 10th (or 11th?) visit nets you a free entree. 

Its really the little things that edge Moe's over Chipotle for me. It also seems like a more down to earth, less pretentious place than Chipotle.",2013-04-06 00:42:47

First up was the guacamole, as I saw the cart for made-at-the-table guac being pushed around and got excited for fresh avocado. Our order was NOT made at the table, for which no explanation was given. It was also TINY and badly in need of salt. I suspect a premade and refrigerated vat of the stuff, scooped out with an small ice-cream scoop. The chips were bland and stale (think rubbery.)

For the entree, I got the tacos barbacoa, and my companions got the enchiladas with mole sauce and the chimichangas.
The tacos were soaked in some kind of oil or grease, so much so that they could not be picked up. The tortillas underneath were literally dissolving. Super gross. The meat - and there was only meat on the tacos, no onions or anything else - wasn't impressive. There were a couple big pieces of gristle I had to discreetly remove. The spicing was not a usual barbacoa, either - I love barbacoa (preferably with goat, which this place notably does not serve), and this tasted like no barbacoa I've ever had. It turns out that that is probably a good thing, as I had an allergic reaction to something in it later that night. My only allergy is cardamom, not usually a barbacoa spice, so who knows what that was. 

The server (who was the one good part of the whole experience) asked my fiancé if he'd had mole sauce before, as they ""make it different here."" They certainly do, but not in a good way! Fiancé's first reaction was that it was ""bland."" Enchiladas in mole sauce is one of the ways he judges a good Mexican place, and this place disappointed. The mole tasted like it was ketchup-based. 

The chimichangas were large but also bland and boring, and not crispy on the outside at all. The rice was yellow, but tasted like plain rice to which tiny bits of frozen carrots and peas had been added.

For all this, also, it wasn't cheap. The far better, far more authentic restaurants in the area are cheaper, too!

Even without the allergic reaction, between the terrible taste and the price, I'd give this place one star. Our waitress is the ONLY reason this place gets two stars. We will not be back.",2015-08-19 13:02:00

It gave the empanadas a great taste. I had two shredded beef burritos with rice. My fiancé had the San Jose burrito and he said it was really good. The other two had fajitas and chicken burritos and they both enjoyed it. They had Negra Modelo on draft and I loved it! Not many places have that beer on draft so it was awesome.

I have come twice so far. Once after a miserable lunch at bertuccis (it was gross) so we had drinks and chips. The don Julio margarita was delicious. I had twice each time and sat at the bar. Salsa is addicting and the bartenders were both friendly which keeps you staying, eating, drinking-you get the idea! Jessica was our bartender today and she is great.

During football games they have 5 dollar beer specials as well as nachos, wings and tacos. Everything was fresh and tasted great. I lived in Texas before and this is what I expected. Also consistent with other plaza aztecas:) fresh chihuahua cheese on top of crispy tortilla chips and no skimping on the meat or beans! Yeah! They have also changed chefs so maybe his speaks to changes in the food since past reviews.

I give 4/5 stars only because they still have kinks to work out. For example I thought my nachos would have cheese sauce vs fresh cheese and it didn't (I preferred the way I got it!) and that's confusing for customers. The food I ate was great and the woman next to me got tacos and I'm debating grabbing one!

Pizza was in the heater to keep it still warm, the fries were in a pizza bag staying warm. They gave me the wrong order of fries, so we had to wait an additional 7 minutes, my pizza looked ok but when we got home to eat, it was so undercooked that we had to throw slices in the toaster oven.

I only ate the toppings and cheese off the top of it. So dissapointing, i tried calling the store twice so they could redeem themselves but no one answered so I had to contact corporate.

This was our first time here... we usually order from blackwood Clementon road because we've never had an issue. They definitely lost our business here, its a bunch of children who are running this chain and they don't know what they are doing.

Now, read this with a grain of salt because I went here unsure of what I could have because I cannot have sugar, gluten, or dairy right now. My 1st visit would have been 3 stars because it didn't wow me, but it didn't really make me think I needed to ever go back either. 

So I ordered the steak, it typically comes with mashed potatoes and broccoli with bread crumbs. I asked if I could switch the asparagus with the mashed potatoes and was told it would be a $1.00 upgrade fee...okay...didn't make sense to me since a side of asparagus was the same price as a side of mashed potatoes in the menu. Whatever, decided to not get the asparagus since I ate a ton of veggies at lunch. I ordered my steak medium...was told it had to be medium well or medium rare because there was no medium. Okay, did medium well because in the past when I get medium rare at places it's way too bloody. 

Okay, bread and oil comes. I do not have any. My friend does...and is unimpressed. Says I'm not missing much and she doesn't even really touch the oil after the first taste because it's just not a good grade of dipping oil. I dipped a spoon in and tried a bit and pulled a nasty face at the taste. 

Well, we only have a faint hope for the meal is good at this point. 

My steak comes...burnt around the edges, and a very sad little pile of broccoli next to it. Steak was well done. Okay, I could have sent it back, but I'm not a send back person, sorry, I just don't trust people. You had your chance when you sent me the food. So, steak is...okay, not amazing, just okay, not what I wanted, just okay, I could eat it. Broccoli...just bad, no flavor, did not eat it. I blame veggies cooked like that for people saying they don't like vegetables. 

My friend ordered the chicken marsala. She said chicken was just okay and the mushrooms, but the potatoes and green beans were funky. potatoes...don't know how they were cooked, just tasted wrong. Green beans seemed old and were overcooked, shriveled, and burnt. She did not finish hers. 

Sooo yep, had we not had the gift card, we would have asked for our money back and just left a few bites in.

Maybe their pasta is good. But if you are gonna have just one steak dish that's almost $20, it better be good and it just wasn't. 

Will never visit a bertucci's again. I seriously think olive garden may even be better, yep, I said olive garden.

The problem lies in the cash only issue. I have no problem paying cash IF the prices didn't change EVERY SINGLE time I go. We buy the same order pretty much every time. Sometimes I pick it up and sometimes my husband. The last 3 times we bought the same 3 items and the cost changed each time (by $1-$2). Now, they also do not provide a receipt so you really don't know what they are charging. If they took credit cards you would obviously be able to tell what you pay. Hmmm....maybe I see why they don't accept credit cards. In any case, it is close to home, and I like water ice and the kids like ice cream, which is why we go. We decided to go today and slightly changed up the order, by ordering 2 less toppings on 2 of the ice cream sundaes, however, it cost me .75 MORE! How is this possible?!

No taste, literally just mashed avocado with tons of red onion. The fajitas were ok. I made one. The plate of condiments for the fajitas (cheese, sour cream, pico, and canned retried beans) were kind of all one melted mess so I couldn't really assemble the fajitas.

No recommendations on drinks whatsoever. Drinks took quite a while for beers and wine considering it wasn't very busy at all.

One of the guest in our party is a GM for a restaurant and was appalled at the quality of service and the way in which the server was talking.

We stopped for a quick dinner and to enjoy our evening but it was anything but enjoyable at that point. The table next to us told Dennis that he needed another ice tea and he responded with ""yeah I know it's empty I saw "" you could see how uncomfortable he made the guests at that table.

So They developed a large track of land by the AC expressway in Sicklerville and the economic downturn has kept it largely vacant, but Bertucci's and Texas Roadhouse have opened. I was a little stoked because of all the Italian chains I generally find Bertucci's the least offensive to my heritage.

They're not going to kick anyone Mom Mom out of the kitchen, but they throw together some decent dishes. This past Friday my g/f and I made a pre-movie trip. I kind of wish I hadn't....it definitely cost them a 4 star review.   I've never had the Chicken Marsala before...I consider that a pretty basic dish. I usually go with a more interesting menu item, but I diverted from the game plan and paid the price.  My confusion/dismay started when the dish came out. The penne was the first sign. It was supposed to have Marsala sauce, but appeared dry. When I told the waitress that she told me it was at the bottom, but she'd get me more. So while I waited for the sauce I dove into the chicken. The chicken itself was prepared well and very tender. The Marsala sauce on the other hand was terrible. Bertucci's is chain so I assume the sauces come prepackaged and they just reheat them. It appeared to me the sauced wasn't reduced, nor did it have any Marsala flavor....just a brown watery mess. When the waitress brought the side of sauce it was the same mess. Dinner did not impress me one bit.  I started with a Cesar salad which was enjoyable. It was a little dressing heavy, but I will take heavy dressing over not enough any day.  I should also mention the fresh baked rolls. I'm sure by fresh baked that means they took them out of the freezer and put them on a baking sheet, but they're still warm and delicious. I'll mop a plate of olive oil with one any day.
A couple of positives: we showed up 8:30ish pm on a Friday and were seated within 5 minutes. Our server was very attentive, almost to the point of annoyance, but she took care of us and was always close. We were shooting for a 9:55 movie and I was nervous about making it, but we were out of there before 9:30. 
I do like Bertucci's and hopefully next time around I can drop the 4 star on them.",2009-06-07 02:46:01

Rr Our server might as well ignored us, he barely checked on us at all. We either had to waive him down or ask another server to find him, which I hate doing. My friend had a dirty glass. That was first, ok accidents happen. I asked for extra olive oil butter he bought me out a few bottles of herbs for me to prepare myself..huh? How would I know what or how much to add.  He totally forgot my dinner salad and when3 I reminded him his response was ""well do you still want it?""  I normally get the shrimp scampi which is generally =0delicious was dry as a bone.

The plate was so ginormous. They were , at best, mediocre. For lunch I had the Burrito Chipotle. It was awful. I didn't eat more than 3 bites. It was stuffed with refried beans, barely cooked green peppers, rice and chicken. It had such a strange smokey sausage taste. I couldn't stomach it. My friend had quesadilas that were okay. We ordered margaritas on the rocks that tasted like (what one would imagine) lime dish water. So gross. When it was time to drop off our check, the waitress asked if I wanted a box. I declined. She asked if everything was okay. I told her I didn't like my meal. She asked if I wanted a different entree, which I didn't. I didn't complain about my dish because, let's face it, sometimes you just don't like the taste of something.

I've exhausted all of the Cross Keys Rd-Sicklerville area restaurant options many times over and needed something new and fresh!  Mexican is our go-to about 2-3 times per week (either cooking at home or eating out) so I was so hype when we had a chance to check out Plaza Azteca on a Sunday right before the dinner rush.

The atmosphere was very trendy and right away I could tell (since they didn't have a menu online) that it was going to be a pricey meal.  We were seated right away, ordered waters (it was family night), and given chips and salsa (a must at a good mexican joint)!  After browsing the menu, my hunch about the prices was correct, but seemed to be a bit all over the place.  For example, it's $7 for soup but only $9 to create your own 2 item combo meal.  I really wanted the grilled pineapple guacamole, but the ingredient list included goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes.  As much as I love both of those items, I wasn't feeling courageous enough at the time to have it in my guacamole with pineapples.  We went with the classic guacamole, which was quite tasty, but as you can see from my picture it was as big as an ice cream scoop.  Whomp. Whomp.

Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu items.  We expressed our disappointment in the lack of children-friendly mexican style selections.  When we asked her if the Yucatan Enchiladas were spicy, since my daughter wanted to split them with my husband, she brought over a sample of the salsa verde for her to try to see if it was the right heat.  Very much appreciated!  We ordered the Yucatan Enchiladas and Al Pastor Tacos and all three of us split the two dishes.  The Al Pastor tacos were a miss mostly due to flavor but also because the homemade tortilla completely fell apart on my first bite.  Tacos always fall apart on me, but usually I can get at least halfway through before I need to use my fork.  This time it was basically all fork.  

Our bill came to $45 (after gratuity) for two dinner items and guacamole.  In my opinion it was quite pricey for the quality and amount of food.  I wasn't over the moon about any of the dishes, however they satisfied my Mexican cravings.

The restaurant was pretty much empty that is why she had the time to chat and get to know us.
The food was a 3 out of 5 stars, the drinks were way overpriced especially the Tequila i.e. Don Julio Silver shot was $14.00 !!! 
When we chatted the owner said they were gonna review demographics and the menu including pricing. I told her that it was great to have a Mexican restaurant close to home but the drink prices were not comparable to the local restaurants.
We decided to return about six months later and the owner remembered us and said hello and if we could give the restaurant a good review as she said she received a lot of bad reviews, I said ok. Well we were sitting at the bar and the middle aged bartender looked as if he would rather be on Mars then behind the bar, miserable never smiled. It was early around 3pm and not yet busy. When the check came it was probably about 5pm and the bar area was now standing room only and most people had sour puss looks on their faces as the owner was behind the bar seemingly doing nothing, all the while the solo bartender was overwhelmed, you would think the owner that wants good reviews would have rolled up her sleeves but that didn't happen. 
Our bill was about $120. with tip, I handed a ten dollars off coupon if you spend $50. and the bartender showed it to the owner and she looked over at us, the bartender said I'm sorry it's not valid on Saturdays, I then looked at the extremely fine print and he was correct, it was good everyday but Saturdays. 
So the owner is asking for good reviews from us, we spent $120. this time and our first visit in which she was the bartender and we generously overtipped her and she wouldn't take a $10 coupon.

When we told the waiter it was our 1st time, he gave us a free Brick Oven Tuscan Veggies to try in addition to bringing us yummy rolls with a seasoned garlic oil to dip in. 

The menu was different then and I ordered a seafood risotto, which was actually really good!

Being Bertuccis is a chain restaurant we were surprised!  Plus if you took the survey on your receipt, they sent you coupons for your next visit. I love coupons, lol. 

Since then, we've been there a couple times and it's been ""iffy"". The menu changed twice on me, which I found hard to find something I would order and enjoy. 

A big upset is that they did away with their crab stuffed mushrooms. They were 5 stars!! 

Beginning in June, I got an email that their summer menu (in addition to their new regular menu) introduced Pan Seared Mussels in a red garlic sauce as an appetizer or as dinner served with a side of spaghetti with fresh garlic & olive oil. 

The pic in my email, I had to get my hubby to take me. 

So, we went for lunch and luckily for us, before 3pm they give you free salad. I enjoyed the appetizer with the bread that they served to dip. 

What I did not like is how long it took for someone to not only seat us, but wait on us. It seems the entire staff were very young and more impressed with their phones than customers.  I also didn't like that if you're not there by 3, you have to pay for a soup or salad. It doesn't come with any entree. That's crazy to me!

Anyway, not wanting to wait, we decided to do there carry out since they send 25% off coupons to my email. 

My son & daughter ordered Chicken Parma Dinner while my hubby and I both order the Pan Seared Mussels with the spaghetti. 

I give them a 3 bc sometimes The Mussels entrees are awesome but sometimes they are mostly empty shells in a tomato sauce. Not so good. 

But, you roll the dice when ya gotta coupon and feel like Mussels. Lol 

My daughter will eat the chicken Parma but my son says it's aweful. 

So 3 stars but we will probably still order carry out now & then as long as they continue with the Mussels bc I don't find anything else I'd adventure to order on their regular menu. 

I have to say that this time in my pics below, the Mussels were really good except for a lot of empty shells.",2017-09-02 03:42:47

We all enjoyed our plentiful meals. For me, seafood chimichangas (not fried). Tasty & doughy! and w a nice cheese sauce. (I didn't care for the celery in it though). Came with the BEST refried beans Ive ever (?) had and great rice. 

Vince had chicken chimichangas (fried) and the same two sides. The chicken was shredded and juicy -  not too spicy. 

My guys' kids meals were nice sized portions & well liked. See pix!

There are not many beers on draft, but there are more bottle varieties. There is a respectable amount of cocktails.
I went with four stars instead of three (which is more average) because of the flexibility they offer. I ordered a chicken pasta dish without chicken (I'm a vegetarian), and they let me substitute any kind of vegetables in it instead. This is very...admirable. Not many restaurants are so willing. 
The tiramisu is the way to go - the flour less chocolate cake is too much like fudge, they haven't mastered the texture. And the lemoncello dessert had great lemon flavor but was saturated with raspberry syrup. Just looking at the chocolate layer cake made me not want chocolate for a week.

My wife had been chilly all day and our table was directly under a vent blowing cold air. We asked the friendly server for another table citing the cool breeze (but silently hoping also to get away from the vocal infant.) She offered to have the heat turned on and left. Moments later the cool air did indeed turn warm...For about 10 minutes. 

Rest rooms were not clean. The women's room was visibly dirty and the men's room only smelled rank. 

We ordered one serving of spaghetti to share. We asked about the different sauces offered and selected the one we were told contained lots of meat.

I got a steamed pork dumpling appetizer and the shrimp with garlic sauce and shrimp fried rice. My son got a general's chicken combination. Around 8:15 I called to see where the food was and they assured me that it was on the way. 10 minutes later the delivery guy arrived. 

The shrimp with garlic sauce was terrible. I can't quite  describe what it reminded me of but it was gross. My son's general's chicken was tough and very chewy. He didn't finish it, which never happens. The egg roll was passable. Our steamed dumplings were more like bread rolls with a nugget of mystery meat inside. They are supposed to be thin and moist. These were doughy and dry. The fried rice was bland, I've found that any place who uses that yellowish rice is never a good sign.

We didn't order guacamole, which we regretted when we saw that it's made fresh to order at your table side.  Very impressive, that!

We were seated right away, restaurant was clean, greeted immediately by our waitress who did an excellent job during our visit and could not have been nicer.  Rolls were fresh out of the oven and we received our drinks within minutes.  
Now the negatives. We were given hot, yes hot, plates for our salad.  Waitress warned us about this and apologized at least twice (you could tell she was embarrassed to give us hot plates for a cold salad) but stated they ran out of plates and these were straight out of the dish washer.  Brushed this off, no biggie as things happen, we actually used our bread plates for the salad instead.  A few minutes later I heard the manager (?) inform the serves that they had run out of romaine lettuce, this was around 1pm on a Saturday.
Now here's the kicker.....I ordered the tuscan veggie calzone, which is described on the menu as 'Brick oven roasted eggplant, zucchini, artichokes, tomatoes and Asiago'.  What I received was a calzone that was filled with more broccoli and tomatoes than anything else, honest to God I think there was only one piece of eggplant, no zucchini at all, and a few artichokes.  I couldn't wait for another to be prepared since I was with an antsy 7 year old, so I ate half and took the other half home.  Now the calzone as it was prepared was tasty, but I absolutely can not stand when the menu describes an item and it's prepared a different way.

Check the menu before you go because they don't really change up the entrees. I asked if they had a plain salad, like a side or house, and was told no- just what's on the menu. They kinda rush you out too and when we went it wasn't busy at all, in fact it was kind of dead. They were cleaning off the table literally seconds after we finished eating, it was weird.

The chain was started by 2 Mexican natives in 1994, and has spread throughout the east coast with over 30 locations now. It is definitely better than other similar corporate Mex places.

A groupon brought us here, and for an easy and economical family meal we were pleased. We liked the large space that had a more open feel than many south of the border shops that we find ourselves in. A sign at the entrance advertised some drink specials, when I saw $2 for a 16oz Dos Equis, I knew that would be what I was drinking. The menu was fairly large with most of the usual suspects, but also some more Americanized plates. Even a good selection of kid's meals.

We started with table made guac, you can tailor it to your own taste and the avocados were good and mostly ripe. But if you prefer it creamier as we do, you might want to specify from the start. The chips were not to my liking, definitely from a bag, I did like the salsa though. Both kids liked their choices, and we even had to order more beef tacos for the pickier of the two.

Trish ordered seafood chimis, but unfried. She liked but I thought they had a fake seafood flavor. She didn't think she would order again. I had chicken chimis fried of course, and I was happy with the choice. The chicken was tender and nicely seasoned, tortillas nice and crispy, with just a little bit of cheese sauce. I added salsa and jalapeños to up the spice level. The sides of rice and beans were both pretty good too. We ended the meal with something the kids were not expecting, churros. 3 of us really liked them, warm and crispy with cinnamon sugar on the outside and caramel in the middle, plus a little container with even more to be drizzled on them at our will.

Even without the groupon the prices seemed pretty fair. With it we felt like thieves. Service was friendly and quick throughout, but they appear to do quite a business on a Saturday night, so plan for that. Armed with another groupon and the kids, we would probably return. On our own, probably not. 3.5 is there such a thing as an authentic chain Yelps",2016-02-28 19:27:10

Tom, who left me with my quote was the perfect person for me to talk to. He explained in detail what they were going to do and why they were the right options for me and my home. Someone else left a review about him seeming to be like an old friend giving advice, this is beyond accurate. Great guy to work with.

Then comes the install crew. Shoutout to Damien, Robert, and Daniel. They took their time, didn't rush the job when it started to get late and continued to provide me with the customer service I hoped to have. They let me ask dumb questions and answered them politely without making me feel like a dope (which I am in the HVAC knowledge department). They explained everything in depth and made sure I was comfortable before leaving. 

This was an expensive project but considering how much I like the product, people, and service, it was well worth it. I look forward to getting more work done by Bovio in the future. Your people are the reason more than the product that I will use Bovio in the future.",2017-10-10 12:04:08

I ordered the Burrito San Jose ($8): it was an open ended burrito filled with chicken, chorizo, rice, and beans, followed by a smothering layer of cheese, sour cream, and a sprinkle of tomato salsa.  This thing was seriously gargantuan, and so are the portion sizes for anything else on the lunch menu.  I'd imagine their dinner menu, which can cost a few extra bucks for the same items, provides an even larger portion.  The chicken and spinach enchiladas ($8) comes with 3 enchiladas similarly smothered in a spinach sauce and a rice/bean side dish.  Their guacamole appetizer ($8), while looking small in some of these pictures on yelp, is similar to form and is a decent size - probably 1.5-2 avocados.  It's not particularly memorable or unique, but it's honest guacamole at the basic level.  Unlimited chips and salsa (somewhat basic, kind of like purred tomatoes) are provided.

ダンキンドーナツって、1998年に日本からなくなってもう17年になるのですね。西武から引き継いだ吉野家が止めてしまったんですね。

普段アメリカ東部をドライブしていると頻繁に見かけるので、実は日本から消えて居るのに気づいて居ませんでした。

ここはフィラデルフィアの南40kmほどの小さな街にある路面店です。

アメリカでは、各種ドーナツの他に、マフィン、ベーグルサンドイッチ、タコスなども販売して居り、コーヒーもなかなか美味しく、アイスコーヒーもあります。

ここのオールドファッションドーナッツ、ミスタードーナツのものより甘さ控えめ、油も控えめでとても美味しいのです。

日本でも再開してほしいお店です。

Salad served in one huge bowl without a spoon or tongs or any way to serve our individual portions or plates or bowls to put them in.

Entrees came out about 8 minutes after the appetizers, which we had barely started.  Advised the waiter that we would prefer a little time to finish the appetizers to no avail, he just slid the large entree plates onto the table and got away fast.  Didn't see much of him after that.

Since it was new at the time, I figured I would give it another chance to see if they improved.  Big mistake!  We were seated and our waitress took our drink order quite promptly.  My wife had the house wine which she was quite happy with. I ordered the Sangria with cinnamon.  Although it tasted fine, the glass was 75% ice with very little Sangria.  Next came the rolls which were not fully baked and had the taste and texture of Play-Doh.  My wife suggested (tongue in cheek) to save it and use it for fish bait - it will never fall off the hook. However, I doubt that even the fish would eat it.  The broccoli and sausage flatbread was that we ordered for an appetizer was very good.  However, the shrimp scampi that my wife ordered was well below average and it was quite evident that the shrimp was frozen.  My entree of shrimp and scallops on a bed of spaghetti with a tomato cream sauce was a total disappointment.  In addition to shrimp and scallops being frozen, the spaghetti was overcooked and was all clumped together.  The tomato cream sauce tasted like it came from a can of Chef Boyardee Spaghettios.

Their kids meal, at least the cheese quesadilla, was very paltry in size, (flat tiny square) and came with the teeny tiny bag of chips and white rice that they didn't like because it had cilantro flavoring. I couldn't add meat or beans to their quesadillas because they were spicy and my kids can't eat spicy. So we ended up paying eight dollars for very little food, no toy, no dessert. We go to California Tortilla at home, and they give a huge handful of chips to the kids and their quesadilla is two large pieces that come with beans and chicken, and that are not spicy. They also come with a kids coloring page and a brownie for dessert. Same price. 

My bowl was decent in size, but high priced to begin with and then it didn't even come with guacamole unless you paid an extra two dollars. I couldn't hear what the woman on the other side of the counter was saying about the guacamole when she was putting it in my bowl, so I didn't realize that I had paid two extra dollars until after I checked out.

But because a lot of people somehow still manage to confuse how to order food from Chipotle or the sheer variety of food there... [ahem]

-- The Chipotle Ordering Process -- 
1. Go to the left side of the line. No, don't stand in front of the cash register, that's the end of the line.

2. Pick between a Burrito, Bowl (Burrito without the shell. I'm here all day), 3 Tacos, or a Salad. All of these are the same price -- you only pay for the meat you select.

3. Pick between White or Brown Rice, Black or Pinto Beans, and if you want Fajita Veggies.

4. Pick between Chicken, Steak, Barbacoa (Pulled Beef), Carnitas (Pork), Sofritas (Vegan Tofu), or Veggie (Guacamole). This is practically the only time in this whole operation where the price could change. Just about everything else is 'free'... so don't skimp on the toppings. Load up.

5. Pick between Mild, Medium or Hot Salsa; cheese; sour cream; and guac. You do pay extra to add Guac unless you selected a Veggie item in Step 4.

6. Pay for your item. Yeah this step isn't optional, sorry about that.

--

...not saying it's hard to order. In fact, it's pretty easy and straightforward. But for those of you who are indecisive like I, and like a little heads up before showing up... this is my gift from me to you.

So why Chipotle over Moes? Chipotle is a bit pricier and has less variety, but you get what you pay for. I find that Chipotle's food quality is a bit higher up than Moes and because they serve less options, everything's just fresher and tastier. If you want a  freestyle Coke Machine or free nachos... yeah Moes is your option.

But if you want good Mexican Food, at a fair price, with great ingredients, you'd be crazy not to pick Chipotle methinks.",2013-12-28 03:09:21

I had a flavor(party cake) I typically dont go for and was sold. Only downside was their version of gelatis was lacking a bit in my opinion (no double layers) but nothing major, I just know to ask next time.

Otherwise...

And no outrageous prices! Whaddya know... U can go to ritas and get the same thing for like $3 more or come to creanies and not hate yourself for eating ice cream and paying so much for it.

I never really tried their different water ice flavors so I can't help anyone on that note, but the soft serve ice cream is literally the best I've had.  Don't know what it is about it, I'm sure they use many of the same ingredients as other places, but they just consistently provide the best ice cream creations in the area.

First, my waiter definitely wasn't happy to be at work, this day. When I sat down, he came right over to ask if we were ready to order drinks. Nothing wrong with that, but I couldn't make up my mind so I asked for some suggestions. This should have been easy because the waiter claimed he was normally the bartender and he started running down different selections. I ended up going with a dirty martini. Now, most people I know luv extra olives with this martini, so of course I asked for extra. He said ok, but when the drink came, there were only two olives, which is standard. I'm trying to think positive so I asked for extra olives again. His response was a bit amusing, he told me they really didn't have a lot of olives but he would see what he could do. I found that a bit strange because how are you going to make dirty martinis with a limited supply of olives. I decided to keep it cool and just wait to see what he was going to do. Finally, after 5 mins, he came back with 2 more olives. I looked at him like he had 4 heads and just kept quiet. 

Rule #1, don't mess with a woman that's a big tipper, of course he didn't know his tip was decreasing by the minute. Next, this man would not give me time to look over the menu. He kept coming over to ask if I was ready to order, I kept advising him I needed more time. I was trying to get in a few sips of the dirty martini that was overflowing with plump olives(Ha!), but he wouldn't let me. Finally, I guess he was getting frustrated with my delay, so he came over to ask if I had any questions about the menu. Now, this man asked me, when I first sat down, had I been there before. I told him yes, so I would think he would understand I didn't need his help making a selection. When you don't eat meat, you have to review menu carefully, so I don't order something I'm not going to eat. I ended up going with the Cod Picatta. Now, here is where he totally crossed the line. He asked, did I know what caper's were?? Now, this is not an upscale restaurant, it's a chain Italian restaurant. Nothing fancy about it, maybe a half step above Olive Garden. In my experience, you never ask a patron of they know what an ingredient is, you wait for them to ask you, if you are unsure. Maybe, some people are not familiar with caper's but since I have two bottles at home in fridge, I'm not in that category. I explained to him, I know exactly what they are and in the future, it's best to wait to be asked a question about an ingredient instead of assuming someone is unsure of what they are ordering. 

Man, this visit isn't going well and I was actually ready to go. But, since I had this clean martini in front of me, I had to do something to make it dirty. So, I got up and found the manager. I asked her were they running low on olives today?? She replied, ""She wasn't aware of that, but she needed to check"". I told her about my experience with trying to acquire extra olives and she didn't look to happy. She told me she would look into it and get back to me. I decided while I was up to go to the bathroom and when I returned to my table, I was greeted with a large bowl of the rare, precious olives, the waiter had been hoarding for himself. 

This review is way to long but I really needed to speak up about this. I hope any one reading this understands the importance of keeping your customers happy, so they will return to your establishment. In this case my main problem was corrected but the damage had already been done. I'm not returning.",2016-09-18 17:00:00

I also ordered some table-side guac (which I love), but the ""server"" who made the guac for us was not hygienic, and was the busboy. He was also extremely awkward and uncomfortable to be around. It seemed like it was it first time serving table-side guac. Finally, when we finally got the bill, it was way more expensive than we expected!

Overall, we found this restaurant to be decent, but not a place we will be clamoring to return to anytime soon.  On the plus side, the food is fairly good, portions are generous and prices are moderate.  We also thought the restaurant itself was clean and pleasing, and service was friendly and attentive.

On the downside, this is Americanized Mexican food and not close to authentic.  The chips served were thin, out-of-the-bag tortillas.  The salsa was watery/pureed and possibly from a jar, although I am not sure.  We ordered grilled pineapple guacamole as an appetizer, which sounded interesting, but in reality was a bit odd tasting, being overpowered by pungent goat cheese.  Hubby ordered the fish tacos and he liked them.  I had a small taste and would rate them as decent to good.  I ordered the seafood chimichanga and it was good, but didn't blow my socks off.  I was very disappointed in my dessert, fried ice cream.  It was not fried at all, but rather a ball of ice cream that was rolled in plain, unflavored, crushed corn flakes and then drizzled with (what tasted like) Hershey's syrup from a can.  If you've had fried ice cream, you know that the fried cinnamon-infused coating (and most importantly, the fact that it is FRIED) is what makes it so distinctive and delicious and what gives it its name.  

So all in all, an okay experience. It wasn't bad, but we weren't impressed either.  If you've never had authentic Mexican food and are used to Americanized Mexican, you may like this restaurant.  But if you have been to Mexico, or have eaten at authentic Mexican restaurants, you may be disappointed in Plaza Azteca.",2016-08-07 10:57:28

Grace who works behind the customer service desk needs a lesson in customer service herself! I'm not sure why everytime I come into this location she is beyond miserable and doesn't want to go out of her way to help anyone. Her body language tells it all! She is never happy, she always looks bothered and it's an issue that needs to be taken care of right away.

I've been a manager for the past 2 in a half years and my customers never leave disappointed. I always go out of my way so I know they will shop with us again. At this location you can really tell customer service is not a priority. I believe this store needs to go through training in order to make it a better experience. You say it's about the guest, but is it really?

I came in Monday morning september 25th, and had an issue with Grace, which was not the first time.... nor my last considering I had another issue with her tuesday September 26th.

If something is in the wrong place and a guest finds it and shows you where it was, than it is that price. Instead we went back and fourth because she clearly does not know how to do her job OR give good customer service. Instead I was inconvenienced.

Here is a clear photo of an item i was purchasing but was told I could have a dollar off than have it for the $1 it stated it was.

The pix of this ""new limited time flavor/ingredient"" that they call ""Carne Asada"" looked so yummy my mouth watered!!!  It said it was their tenderest steak, cut into slices and seasoned with lime wedges and cilantro (2 of my favorite ingredients in Mexican Food!). 

So, of course I showed hubby and wrote a text message for him to take with him of what I specifically wanted so he can just read it to the person at the counter for our carry out order.  My son does the same and hubby decides what he wants while in line. (Hint: if you do this list ahead of time and just read it to them it makes the whole process there so quick and easy. If you don't know your options, just go online to their site and view the menu before heading over). 

Anyway, I ordered The Bowl with a Double Portion of the Carne Asada with a small portion of the cilantro lime brown rice and Fresh Tomato Salsa on the side to add in myself.  OMG!  It was off the charts of Yumminess!!  That Steak (Carne Asada) is 5 Stars all by itself!!  You have to try it while they carry it. I wish they'd put it on their permanent menu!!  Then, I added just a couple spoons of that fresh tomato salsa and I was in heaven. 

I gave hubby, Anthony and Catarina a taste and they all loved it & wished they had ordered it too. 

Anthony ordered the Salad Bowl with Chicken, Cheese, The Tomatillo Red Chile Sauce, Sour Cream & Guacamole and he hobbled the entire thing in minutes. 

Hubby ordered his usual order:  The Steak Burrito (not the new Carne Asada I had) with Brown Rice, Black Beans, Fajita Veggies and Sour Cream. He always enjoys it. 

I'll be posting pics so you can see for yourself. 

Again, I really recommend that Carne Asada and hope Chipotle decides to offer it as a regular item, rather than limited time!!",2019-09-22 23:36:36

So, My hubby and I decided to try finally try it with Ant's latest order especially since the Chipotle commercials have been running slit and it looked pretty good. 

While my son is more familiar with their food and their different ingredients, he ordered a burrito filled with a combo with lots of fillings that I've never had (and some never heard of), so I went to their website to explore. 

I chose the burrito filled with steak, brown rice, extra tomato salsa and extra sour cream as well as a side of Chips and queso. Hubby trusted me and ordered the same as he went personally and ordered in the store & brought everything home. 

OMG!!!  The burrito is humongous!!!!  I cut it in half bc I knew I'd never get thru all of that. But let me tell you how I was so surprised of each delicious bite!  (Can't wait til tomorrow when I eat the other half, lol!)

The chips were so crunchy and yummy alone with that hint of lime, then to dip into that queso....mmmmmm!  (I also took a little queso & put it on my burrito...yumminess!!!

They said they could not work on it because of the bad heat exchange and company policy says they are not allowed. Fair enough at that time. He went straight to telling me I need a new system.

He walked in, I had it all open already, tried to light it and said the flame isn't high enough and as he was working explained how the thermocoupler actually worked. He took it out, put back in my new thermocoupler, the one they told me was the wrong one, cleaned out the pilot light port, it started right up. He shut it down and did a couple things to check the heat exchange and said he didn't believe there was any cracks.

When I was ready to drive I just went inside, spoke to the gentleman at the front desk and within minutes I was introduced to Dana Franks. She was so pleasant, easy to talk to, and the furthest thing from a pushy, haggling salesperson. The financing process was so easy, and so straight forward. I was approved within minutes - with multiple options - allowing me to choose what was best for me. Dana walked me through the whole sales process, explaining to me my coverage options. The woman who assisted me with signing my paperwork, Tess, was also a gem. Once the paperwork was signed, Dana walked me over to my new vehicle - I was shocked to see they had put a big bow on it for me! How cute! Dana took my photo with the car too!

This place screwed up enough orders mid-COVID to warrant driving an extra 15 minutes to Deptford.  At the time, you literally had to rip open the sealed bags to make sure you got everything you ordered...even though there's a list attached to the bag detailing everything.  They did it enough to make one suspect it was a running joke; people constantly coming up while you waited for your order, complaining something was missing or wrong.  Everybody makes mistakes but, jeez.

Now that they're *almost* back to normal serving, they have to resume the old ""we don't have that today"" gag.  This location is always out of something, this time it was fajita veggies.  Just out of onions and peppers today, sorry pal.  If they're not ""out of something"" they're running low on it, so you get bean paste scrapings or solidified rice from the bottom of the bin.

The chips were warm and crispy and the complementary salsa was fresh and chunky. Though I didn't indulge, table side guac was certainly a huge hit and wildly popular throughout the crowded restaurant. 

The fajitas for two portion was HUGE... a heaping steaming pile of well seasoned chicken, onions, and peppers served with freshly grated cheese, rice, refried beans, sour cream, pico, and flour tortillas. The leftovers alone could feed two people for days.

He then told me that there was no local office and they were actually 40 miles away! At any rate he told me that I needed a fan motor and gave me an estimate of $640 and I agreed. He switched the motors and then told me that I needed a computer board. He said that would be another $600 and they would give me a call to arrange it. In the meantime he hotwired my new motor. Well the next day they sent an email quoting the price but before I could even respond the new motor burned out! I called them to ask for someone to come out ant they said that they wouldn't come out until I authorized the payment for the computer board to be installed. I explained to her that the motor was burning and I had to shut off my system and she said yes that could happen.

My neighbor had bought their beach home from one of the partners and assured me I needed a quote for the system replacement.  The company sent out a sales associate named Frank.  Frank was very personable, but was very interested in selling me what he wanted to sell (high efficiency, expensive equipment), and not very interested in solving my problem.  I waited for the second contractor to bid who happened to be the Trane distributor, and he brought to my attention that the building code required 48"" clearance for the high efficiency units and that he would stay away from them.  I contacted ""Frank"", who responded ""If Trane can't install it, we can't either."".  I was impressed.  The third contractor came out and said that the actual code required 12"" clearance.  I responded to Frank again, who then responded.  Yes, that contractor is right.  I can install the high efficiency unit.  I got another proposal from Frank which was higher than the Trane unit which I didn't expect.  As luck would have it, our A/C failed, so I had to make a decision.  Trane was my first choice, Frank who sells Carrier was my second, and Rheem was third.  My wife and I applied for SJ Gas financing and was approved.  When I contacted ""Frank"", he then told me the loan was not correct, blah blah blah.  At this point, I was done with Bovio Rubino, and executed the contractor with the Rheem distributor.  In summary, Frank did not care about construction codes or did not know--so that is always a good indicator of the quality of work you would expect.  The financing issue--well, I just told Frank to get a job at Comcast.  He would probably be a manager there.  I would never get a quote from Bovio for anything.

This place was chosen for dinner by family that we rarely see. Service was slow, but I chocked that up to it being Friday night. I asked the waitress if the chips were cooked in a dedicated fryer and she had to check (they were not, so I chose not to eat them). I ordered a frozen margarita. It was good, but so sweet that I couldn't finish it. My husband ordered guacamole for the table. A guacamole cart came over and when I asked the woman if she was wearing latex gloves (which I have an anaphylactic allergic reaction to), she didn't speak English and called someone else over. He said that they were not latex and when he showed me the box, it was clearly labeled ""latex gloves."" The rest of the table ate the guacamole, but I opted not to put myself at risk. This then made me worry about whether my dinner was handled with latex--which I'm guessing it was.

To register for the vaccine, go to their website to select a date and time that is best for you. Your second vaccine is scheduled during registration as well.

A text message will be sent to you an hour before your scheduled appointment. It will provide a link to check-in. It will only allow you to check-in 15 minutes before your scheduled appointment.  After you are able to check-in, proceed inside.  There you'll be greeted by a receptionist who will give you your vaccination card after your ID and insurance is verified. The card will show the date and type of vaccination received.

A line for the vaccination forms to the right of the receptionist. Social distancing is enforced and visible red dots are on the floor to assist you to maintain the proper social distance of 6' apart. The vaccination is administered in a small room where two CVS Health workers work efficiently.  Trust me, you won't feel the needle.

Afterwards, you'll be instructed to the post vaccine seating area to wait 15 minutes to monitor for any adverse reactions from the vaccination.  Seating is available and the CVS Health Worker in charge of the waiting area will instruct you as to when you can depart the area.   The chairs are spaced 6' apart and there about 9 chairs are available.

I was chatting with CVS Health Worker in charge of governing the 15 minute wait area and she mentioned to me that this was their second week of administering the COVID vaccination.

It is located in the center of a large shopping complex and offered plenty of parking. It was a fairly quiet night and we were seated right away.

We were seated in a smallish booth, which was a little small for four good size adults, knowing my brother in law was getting fajitas. The happily moved us to one of the larger booths across the back of the restaurant.

We were in time for the Happy Hour​special​l so the house margaritas​ were good value and fairly strong.

My husband ordered Burritos Fajitas ($12.50) with chicken. There were two fair sized rolls of chicken meat and onions topped with cheese sauce and sour cream. It was served with refried beans​ and rice. He said it was delicious, but I thought it looked more like an​ enchilada than a burrito or fajita.

I had the Enchiladas​ De Mole Poblano ($13.50) there were three enchiladas filled with chicken​, they were a little on the dry side. The were topped with a deep rich mole that​ had a nice blend of flavors, there just wasn't​ enough of it to moisten the chicken. It may have sat under a heat lamp too long.

First, the technician, I believe was your son-in-law, although I was given a couple of quotes during the last couple of years. Second, I was not given the rationale that you describe. I was told that the chamber would be too expensive in man hours and the part was not under warranty. That is not my miscommunication but through your employee. Third, regardless of whether or not your employees are salaried on a bonus structure or hourly, it doesn't matter as you are the business owner and, like business owners, are trying to maximize both revenue and profit, which I understand. As a final talking point, whether or not it was $7000, the yearly cost of about $350 for a maintenance warranty for both oil heater and central air conditioner is expensive, especially when the warranty does not contain any criteria regarding obsolete parts. Do you consider this the responsibility of your customers who pay this much money only to be told the parts are too labor intensive or obsolete? If so, then I would expect a better and more accurate contract. Frankly, if you couldn't honor the warranty, then I would have expected a direct call from you on what you'd do to compensate me for a service you couldn't provide. Your office was notified of the issue when I canceled my warranty. I'm surprised that as a business owner, you didn't reach out or recall a conversation with me. I tried.

I was with them for a number of years. Signed yearly contracts for several hundred dollars to clean and maintain my heater and central air conditioner. For years, I didn't have a problem with putting the money out for this since it gave me peace of mind, right up until they started pushing me to replace the oil heater. Researching the avg life of one, it was not within this range. For two years, I declined the replacement and the final straw for me was when they informed me that a key part of the heater needed to be replaced and that it wasn't covered under the warranty/contract. Nowhere in that existing contract was a stipulation or limitation of parts to be replaced. I was shocked and quite disappointed. Needless to say, I did not renew my contract and yet by some miracle, the heater is still working. Were they pressuring me with sales tactics to lay out nearly $7,000 for a new system? My guess is yes.

I am all for supporting our small businesses during this economic recovery but I'm also for being an aware consumer. It's too bad that people in these high skilled trades can mask services for higher profit. Let the buyer beware and shop around.",2021-08-11 19:08:57

This is a large Mexican restaurant, with a fairly extensive menu. I would describe the food as ""American"" Mexican, which is certainly not a bad thing, just not necessarily as authentic as you might get at other places. Just know before you go.

Unfortunately, the food and service were less than inspiring. We did get the tableside guacamole, which tasted very good, though I thought they could have salted it and used a little bit more lime juice. It certainly wasn't bad, just a bit bland. The way they prepare it is a little odd, they actually put plastic film in the stone vessel, and then make the guacamole. It's a little strange eating guacamole out of a volcanic stone vessel, lined with plastic overflowing onto the table. As an appetizer I got the queso fundito which is sausage and cheese. This was a huge disappointment, as when it came it was a huge oily mess. Not appetizing at all, and I ate just about none of it.

Both my dad and I got lunchtime combo meals, and they were both just OK. My meal had a taco that obviously had been sitting in the kitchen for a while, as a completely disintegrated when I went to eat it. The bottom of the taco was completely soft and wet.  The rice and beans that came with both meals were actually very good, and the burritos and other items were just ok. 

I found the service to be very slow, especially for a time that probably had only about 25% of the tables occupied. We got there a bit early, about 11:30 AM, so before the big lunch rush. The service was very slow, and they really seemed fairly disorganized.

TkQGfybbfX-rpJu5lcGdSg,IdnxYm4Sy7LIK9L_weXnyg,i39XLqAolwphb5zkZVId_A,5,1,0,1,"My absolute FAVORITE ice cream place EVER. 

I'm a Sicklerville native, so I'm almost obligated to be a Creanie's patron, but that doesn't mean that I'm obligated to think they're amazing... With that being said, they are actually truly amazing. They have a wide selection of hand dipped and soft serve ice cream flavors, as well as water ice and Yum Yum, which is similar to water ice, but with a dairy additive, and let me add that Yum Yums are delish, my second choice when I'm not indulging in ice cream from Creanie's. To top it all off, their topping selection is great, as well (heh, get it..? Top it off.. Toppings.. Ah never mind). Oh! Let me not forget to mention that their hand dipped flavors also include a few sugar-free and fat-free yogurt options, which were a godsend while I was dieting a year or so ago. 

They have a drive-thru and a walk-up window, with outdoor seating available. It tends to get crowded in the summer, but what ice cream place doesn't? Especially a place as awesome as Creanie's. Parking can be a smidge iffy, but once again, what do you expect in the middle of the summer? They also DO accept credit cards now, but there is a small fee (a dollar, I think..?) -- I'm not one to complain about things like this, especially because I appreciate the convenience of being able to use a credit/debit card, but they do PLENTY of business to be able to do away with the fee and still have accepting credit cards be worth it. A small qualm in the midst of such delicious ice-cream-related options, though.. 

The staff is typically made up of younger, late-teen-type adults, but that has never been a problem for me, as they are always on-point and have never messed up any of my orders. They also never give me pushback on my usual strange request, which is a large cup of whipped cream (what?! I need a little extra for my sundae, and share the rest with my dogs!)

Oh! Yes! The dogs! Creanie's also offers 'Puppy Cups,' which consist of a little vanilla soft-serve in a cup, which is 100% dog friendly, and my dogs LOVE IT. I swear they know when I come home from Creanie's and have Puppy Cups in my to-go bag for them.

Overall, Creanie's is great. I've been to plenty of other ice cream places across the country, yet I'm always drawn back to my favorite hometown place. My husband is a Baltimore native, and even HE looks forward to getting Creanie's while up here in New Jersey. We're actually about to head over there now.. Hmm...

I like to end on a positive note, so I'll start with ""The Ugly"".

Maybe I'm a little too ""old school"", maybe I expect too much from a non-franchise establishment, and maybe I'm fed up with fake cheese.  However...don't give me a liquid cheese enchilada and expect me to be okay. You are small, you appear to be (in a quite refreshing sense) ""family run"", and you seem to be generally authentic.  However, my 3 enchilada platter was generally ruined by that aberration.  I could barely taste any of the other sauces for the other enchiladas.  It was really the only dark spot of the meal, but it was such an overwhelmingly bad choice that I just can't get that proverbial processed taste out of my mouth. The service was congenial but abrupt. Our waiter was pleasant, yet just indifferent enough to be a little off-putting.

To be fair...the salsa and chips were way above average. The chips were warm and crisp, not overloaded with grease, and didn't taste like they bathed in salt.  The salsa seemed to be homemade and delicious.  The verde sauce was really, really tasty on one of my enchiladas.  Sadly, it was frequently overpowered by liquid queso debacle that was my platter. The tortilla were soft and delicious, easily melting in your mouth...with an after taste of liquid cheese.  My rice side was well prepared...seasoned well, cooked perfectly, warm, and tender.  Too bad it was, at times, overpowered by...you guessed it...a liquid cheese disaster.

On the whole...I'd love to come back.  I will be honest...I'll be hard pressed to order a ""cheese"" anything here, but the positives do greatly outweigh the negative.  If I can give any layman's advice...stick to the basics and what you do well, because what you do well, you do way better than others.  I just can't get past that cheese.

Our server, Ken was great. Our salad and appetizer were brought out quickly. 
My husband had his usual Ultimate Bertucci pizza. He wasn't waiting for me to take a picture, hence the missing bite.
My chicken piccata was very good. A little salty but still good. 
Our server was nice and told us to sign up for their email. They send out coupons. 
Saving money on not having to cook is always appreciated. 
The Ultimate Bertucci pizza, four cheese ravioli , chicken parmigiana & chicken piccata are all highly recommended.

When it came time for me to trade in my 72k mile Infiniti G37x Coupe and switch up to another AWD vehicle, this time a Nissan Murano...I found plenty to choose from in all trim levels in near new condition.

I hated to part with my 330 HP little speed demon Infiniti G, but it was time!   CarMax gave me a great deal on the trade-in and excellent financing on the Murano.  Steve Southall was the salesman and he made the whole process easy, quick, and simple from start to finish!   I spent more time on the lot looking than I did with him!

He was knowledgeable, friendly, and courteous, even though I was a little anxious and a bit amped up as I usually get when making ANY new or used car purchase (It's not like you make a big purchase like this every day!  LOL!)

Unlike other big-name used car dealers, there was NO pressure to purchase their warranty, plus they give you plenty of time to shop in their lot - no one approaches you until you go inside to inquire about a vehicle.

What you see is what you get.  Since this is a no haggling establishment be ready to accept the offers giving because there is really no room to move any pricing.  Financing and offers were fair.

They have a 5 day return policy on all vehicles as well.  So if you have any issue with your new purchase you can easily exchange or return.

We were brought chips and salsa upon arrival and both were delicious.  Crispy, non-greasy chips and a flavorful salsa with just a hint of spice.

We ordered a pitcher of red sangria, the ceviche, OMG nachos and tableside guacamole.  The tableside guacamole was made in a traditional basalt pig molcajete and was perfectly balanced.  

The spice level was as requested and it was truly delicious.  The sangria, ceviche and OMG Nachos were OMG good.

For entrées I had the Steak Tampiqueña, and two of my dining partners the pork carnitas and the other had chicken tacos. The food was again, delicious and the portions were generous.

We finished off with coffee and three of the desserts: sopapillas, flan and the churros filled with cajeta and served with chocolate sauce - all pretty amazing but the churros filled with cajeta and served chocolate sauce was hands down the best.

If your going to advertise your an Italian restaurant at least be as good as the Olive Garden.",2019-02-27 02:38:07

My wife and I were married here and our experience could not have been any better! The service, the food, and our overall experience was incredible! 

Long story short - I've been to wedding after our big day, and having been through the experience, I compared them to ours. I wouldn't trade my experience and memories here for any venue in our region. 

We first looked at Luciens, The Merion, and a few others. A few things that stood out - 

Whatever we wanted to happen within reason, we were able to get done. (Food, culture, etc)

Our Bridal Attendant or Host did a phenomenal job. She made sure my wife and I always had food, drinks, and information as to what was happening next. Our wedding was bilingual with many Mexican traditions incorporated into an American style wedding. We even had a Mariachi band show up as an surprise/gift to us, and the celebration went on like it was planned from the very beginning. 

The owner was in attendance on staff and frequently checked in to make sure everything was going as planned. 

Thank you Brigalias!",2016-07-03 19:11:13

The menu had many options, I chose the ribs and chicken combo platter, and my friends ordered wings.  We were dining in and were told the food would be out in 10 minutes. Try... 40 minutes. No apology was made for the wait either, so my guess is that its a normal occurance.
The food was mediocre (Definitely not worth the wait). The chicken was very dry, and they tried to overcompensate by drowning it in their sauce. The mac & cheese tasted like it was re-microwaved a few times. I did enjoy their ribs, they were fall off the bone and the sauce on them was tasty.
The wings didn't look too appetizing. My friend compared them to wings you can get from a pizzaria. Not a good sign for a BBQ joint.
I don't live in the area, but we visit a few times a year. I don't think we'll be coming back.",2015-10-23 13:14:15

First off they send you to the deli and it is a night mare. 20 minutes before I was able to finally get someone's attention to pick up the food they said was made an hour before pick up. They had our names wrong and when I wanted to verify the food requested was right (Dietary Concerns) I was told close enough handed the box and that was that. 
By the time I got the box of food home everything was leaking everywhere. Nothing had been packaged neatly to avoid spills. The food was just ok. I have had better at a restaurant and this was supposed to be my wedding food. My fiance and I were not impressed at all. We asked if we could taste some other options at another time. We were told my Megan that ""if they allowed us to keep tasting food, we would be eating for days and they cant do that.""
We were told that the cake was included. We went to the bakery Potitos in Philadelphia. (We were not told the bakery was in Philly until after we signed the contract and paid the deposit) We sampled the cupcakes they had laid out with the fillings then were told that the general cake was included but it would cost us an additional $225.00 for simple buttercream icing and lemon filling. When I asked Megan about this she told me to stop worrying about the cake ""No one was going to eat it anyway.""
Apparently the chapel being built was to be ready for use in February but they already had to break a couples heart because it was not ready for their wedding. 
When we asked about any discounts or options to work with out budget we were told that the owner said No. That with all the renovations they were doing she knew we would be happy and was not willing to work with us. 
Megan didn't know what she was talking about and when I emailed her some of my concerns, I received no response. I called to ask how long it would take for a reply. Megan said ""We do not respond to emails, It is against our policy to put responses in writing."" 
I was finished at that point. When we notified Brigalias that we wanted to cancel our ceremony and reception there. We were never asked why and nothing was offered to try to keep our business. Just that they would mail out the cancellation letter because they had other people who wanted our date. 
Megan reported that we could not use our deposit for another type of event there and if it was not a wedding ceremony or reception that they just keep the deposit. We were so fed up with the terrible service we could care less about the money. 

The grounds are beautiful but the staff is horrible. The customer service is non existent and they are about money money money. We have since signed with Lucien's in Berlin and have been very happy so far with everything. I do not recommend Brigalia's. Don't be fooled by the landscaped grounds.

This place looks like it has been recently redone as everything is clean, new, and fresh.  There is a separate building for wedding ceremonies and such with garden backdrops (some were still in renovation as there were piles of dirt outside in an otherwise landscaped garden).  Very pretty but a bit too much gold for my taste.  We started there and walked to the other building where there was a room for cocktails, a room for a buffet dinner, and then back to the cocktail room for a dessert buffet. So there are lots of options.  I liked the fact that this area was separate from others parties so that brides and guests from different events are not crossing paths.  I like the fact that there were lots of windows in the ceremony space and did not like the fact that there were no windows in the banquet area.  

Food was OK for banquet food. Desserts were four stars.  Coffee was very hot and fresh.

There is not a lot of direction, politeness, or courtesy to guests from the staff there.  Questions were met with brusque answers.   For example, When a guest asked the waitress for cream, the waitress interrupted the conversation of two other guests so that they could pass the cream to waitress who then handed it to the requesting guest.   Gauche.  The server at the carving table called me ""honey"".   You are willing to overlook these things when you are having fun with family and friends.

That aside the event ran smoothly so they are organized and will get you through it.  Be advised that your guests may not be getting the same treatment as you are.",2015-10-18 11:16:10

I turned to Yelp to find a local bbq takeout joint. Buffalo Bill's and their extensive menu tempted our family's tastebuds!  

My first hint there would be issues was from the girl who answered to take my order. She kept putting the phone down to ask someone else about my order specifications and questions. (If you read my reviews, you'll see I always ask to customize my order, including the cook on my food, As everyone should get what they want when they are paying for it). 

My hubby is not picky and just orders directly off the menu as described. He chose the 1/4 Pork Ribd and Chicken Combo with the sides of Mac n cheese & collard greens. He doesn't like to complain but his food was over cooked and dry. 

I chose just The ""St Louis Style Pork Ribs"" and specified a medium rare cook with the same sides as my hubby. 

I didn't even eat it. I tried to bite, then even cut some meat off of the ribs. OMG. So over cooked and desperately dry!  Unfit for my dog kind of cook on those ribs!!!  The Mac n cheese...again dry like saw dust. The collards...just gross. And I'm a Collard Greens fan!  Into the garbage went my entire container!!!

My son wanted pulled pork and a side of mashed. But their menu only says its on a sandwich. So, the girl again questioning ppl if they can serve without the roll. 
My son said the mashed were good. The end of that meal. 

I asked about their wings and the difference between the ones they offered. 

The girl couldn't give me a straight answer. My son likes The buffalo wings from ""Antonio's Pizza"" in Williamstown. He orders them dry but they have spice. I asked if they could do that. She told me I should order the Flour wings, that they were the best. 

Wrong. Hubby & son tried 1 each and into the garbage they went. 

I cannot express what a waste of money this was. So much for our bbq meal we were craving!

His name was Aiden, and he may very well have been the only person serving tables in over half the restaurant, because I don't recall seeing anyone else. He didn't burden us with small talk, but he was warm and friendly as well as sharp and fast. I find that at almost anywhere I eat, if I ask for dipping sauce, the server usually forgets. No big deal, a gentle reminder is all it takes, because servers are pretty busy and condiments aren't as important as the food. But this guy didn't forget.

_5VYBzCfnNsVjqcl7IrCyw,LQ-EL0NrogUrmyOVlOz9Fw,SfaJq_ANWqYnAfiZ3aqOKg,5,7,1,2,"We had our wedding reception at Brigalias in November 2014. From our very first visit to our big day, everything was great. We mainly worked with Megan and Diane, but every staff member we got to talk to was great. 
On our first visit, we got a full tour and details about all the possible reception packages. Megan took her time with us and answered all of our questions. Many other venues we visited seemed to rush us in and out and got annoyed by my questions and note taking, but not Brigalias. 
After we paid our deposit, we got to bring our families to check it out and we had a few other meetings there as our wedding got closer - one to pick out our menu and do the seating charts, one for the final payment, and one to bring in our decorations the week before, etc. We had lots of questions and they were always friendly and provided lots of answers. We got to pick our three dinner entrees, salad, two beer choices for the open bar, and sides for our buffet dinner. A great plus to Brigalias is that they include a cake that you get to pick out (a very delicious cake from Potito's Bakery!). 
At our reception, we walked in and were amazed. It was a perfect mix of the decorations I provided and Brigalias' own personal touches. Our sweetheart table, cake table, gift table and welcoming guest book table were all set up immaculately. I loved the lights and sparkly elements to our sweetheart table. We fell in love with it right away because even without our own decorations and special touches, it looks amazing on its own. The tables were set up beautifully and the centerpieces were large, artifical flowers, but they didn't look fake or gaudy at all (you could substitute your own if you wanted to). The staircase and couch area looked like something out of a 5 star hotel / movie scene.  We had our own bridal party ""getting ready"" area at the top of the stairs. Our guests were ""Oooing"" and ""Ahhhing"" the whole night and kept asking how we found out about Brigalias. We live in Philadelphia, but it was worth it to us to have it at such an amazing venue that was only about a half hour drive away.
We weren't sure what to expect since they didn't go into detail about what the cocktail hour food would be, but it was all amazing! Tons of choices - cheese, meats, mac and cheese bites, mini hot dogs, fried zucchini, and lots more! Our guests were raving about it (and still are). The main dinner was delicious also - roast beef with rolls, chicken parm, ham, mashed potatoes, fettuccini alfredo and veggies. We also had Jessica, a bridal attendant, waiting on us the whole night. She helped carry things when we were taking photos outside, brought us food and drinks, bustled my dress and stayed in touch with the DJ about when the parent dances and game was going to happen.  
I can't say enough about the outside photo area. The Philly love sign was our wedding theme, so the replica was perfect. We loved ""jumping"" on the art museum stairs replica, the beautiful gazebo, carriage, etc. It was nice to know we could go to Brigalias for photos right after our ceremony and not have to run all over town. 
I would recommend Brigalias to any couple getting married. They even have a new chapel that just opened so you can get married there (inside) or outside in back of the building. Their attention to detail, delicious food and customer-focused personalized service set them apart. We will recommend them to everyone we know.",2015-02-06 20:33:27

Once we were seated, the soup and salad hit the spot, and the filet mignon was to die for.  The mashed potatoes even blew my mind.

We saw a great deal for BBB ($13 for $20 to spend) and immediately came to yelp to do some research. It seemed like pretty much the only negative people had to say was that the prices were bad and to us, seeing the menu online, that was laughable. 

We live in New York so of course we are used to steeper prices, however I still don't think that for BBQ this place is even remotely costly. We ordered a full rack of beef ribs which come with 2 sides and corn bread for $20. The two of us split it and still couldn't finish. We each ate two of the massive ribs and about half our sides. We brought 3 ribs and the equivalent of a side home for leftovers. Now even if we hadn't had the groupon, three meals worth of food for $20 is not bad whatsoever, especially for BBQ. We've gotten a similar meal in Dutchess county NY for $30+ (however in our opinion Bills did it better). How could you expect to get ribs anywhere cheaper?

Enough about price... The food was amazing. We really enjoyed how tender the ribs were. The sauce was great, the sides were great, everything was awesome. The staff working were also so friendly and made eating in (although a casual atmosphere) a fun experience. 

My boyfriend who is the most frugal person I know even said after dinner that had the groupon not worked and we paid full price, he would still have felt like we got a great deal for the amount of great food.

First, the layout is not comfortable for dining in.  This is a high traffic place with lots of people coming in to pickup or takeout.  The most comfortable seats are right at the same counter where all the traffic is so it can get quite noisy and some customers waiting for food will rudely stand next to your table.  The tables on the side are arranged poorly and often ""taken"" by staff folding boxes or just taking their breaks.   In other words, dining in can be a challenge, especially during busy times.

Second, a couple of the girls up front don't know what they're doing.  Worse, when you tell them they got the order wrong they get mad at you.  My LAST visit, as in I won't be back, the girl just tossed my dinner plate on the table then came back for a repeat, tossing a basket with a couple of rolls.  This is after the 7th or 8th time she got my order wrong and I had to correct her.  Maybe the computer menu on the register doesn't match the printed menu, or maybe they just aren't trained properly.

At first I did not want the big extravagant wedding, but Brigalia's made this process a breeze. We booked this venue two years a two months before actually saying, ""I do!"" They were there every step of the way, things that we asked for or needed they never said no and tried to accommodate every request as long as they could. We worked with everyone there within those two years and two months and each and every one of the ladies were super helpful, knowledgeable, professional and all around the best people we could have worked with throughout this long and stressful engagement. Planning a wedding is not easy and has its stressful days, but with the girls at Brigalia's it was a breeze. If I could do it all over again I would still pick Brigalia's all over again. Enough about the girls that work there because I could go on and on, the actual venue itself it stunning inside and out. The chapel which is where we got married is such a beautiful area inside and out. The food at Brigalia's was to die for,  although we did not get to eat a lot the day of our wedding. I suggest you try to make it to your cocktail hour because we missed it and everyone at our wedding stated that it was the best cocktail hour they have ever been to. The dinner food everyone raved about and the dessert out of this world! Every single food item I was told it was all to die for. Fortunately, we go to a wedding there this Friday and get to experience it on the other side of things which we are very much looking forward to it. If I could give Brigalia's 6 stars, I honestly would. You get the best bang for your buck booking with Brigalia's from cocktail, to center pieces, cake is included and they have so many add ons. For example, Food trucks, food cart, mashed potato bar, photo booth and much more. The only thing I did not agree with is paying to have your ceremony there, I could understand if you were only having the ceremony there. If you are booking the venue for the whole thing they should allow you to have your ceremony there as long as you are having your reception there as well.

Shrimp Basket: Standard fries, tasty and crispy shrimp and they give you a lot for $6 BUT still had the tails attached--not appetizing to have to pick those out of your mouth.

Crab Soup: Amazing, very rich and very thick. Wish it was more soupy, less paste-like but incredibly tasty. In the words of Guy Fieri, I would eat it on top of a flip-flop it's that good. 

Texas Style Beef Ribs: Delicious sauce, super tender, but there was almost no meat on the bones, the meat that was on it was mostly burnt. I will definitely try their chicken and pork next time. 

Baked Beans: Very sweet, great pairing with everything else. 

Dirty Rice: Good flavor, nice contrast to the sweetness of ribs and beans. 

Chocolate Mint Pie: Very good, interesting flavor. Like frozen thin-mint chocolate pie.

Sweet Potato Cheese Cake: The BEST part of our meal. Recommended by the woman who handled my order. Really creamy, great spices that remind you of fall. I would stop by just to get this after work. Would also eat off of basically anything.

This was about $50 worth of food (piex2). Definitely worth it, some leftovers for tomorrow's lunch. I'm excited to go back and have some better luck with the rest of their BBQs.",2014-10-08 02:51:41

It's a really nice place and the food was excellent, though, it is not without its flaws. 

The cocktail hour had awesome hors d'oeuvres, but, I def agree with another Yelper that the space is small. We had our family taking turns at one table so we weren't separated and it was standing room-only for the most part elsewhere.

 I sampled a bit of everything including scallops wrapped in bacon,Japanese-style salmon carpoccio, lamb lollipops, and crab balls. All checked out awesomely. 

Then it came time for dinner and the main event. The dining/ballroom with a rotunda and a decent-sized dancefloor with a full bar off to the side. There was 3 courses accompanied by bread and butter then coffee plus dessert (passed up, but, it was sweets including build-your-own sundae) back in the room from before. Esacrole (aka Italian wedding soup), salad, and your a choice of entree with a palate cleanser of lemon sorbert in-between. I settled on the filet mignon which came wrapped in bacon with asparagus and bacon mashed potatoes. While I thought it was cooked perfectly, it was served a bit rare. Maybe this is by default since it is being served on a large scale,but, I can see somebody (like my fiance who actually didn't attend) sending it back because they prefer well-done. Nothing went untouched to say the least in the end. 

The service was fine the whole time and the only other issue with Brigalias is that there was only one set of bathrooms to be found and they were near the entrance. This made things awkward at times since some people ran into the bridal party as they were being presented and then had to shuffle around in the vestibule for them to be be finished. 


Otherwise, I wouldn't mind attending another get-together there. 3 stars for B's.",2015-11-15 02:02:54

Luckily with just 3 people in our ""party"" we received a table in less than 10 minutes. The server was great. I wished I remembered her name, but was very attentive. She visited our table about 6 times.  As for the menu, we had many breakfast entrees to choose from. I ordered the Meat Lover's Omelets with toast and home fries. My friend ordered the same meal with peppers and onions and home fries. Lastly, my other friend ordered the Big 2 Do Breakfast.  It had 2 scrambled eggs,2 sausage links, 2 pancakes, and french toast. Less than 20 minutes later, our food was served. The food was amazing and filling. The food was hot enough to eat when it was served. The food looked great and tasted even better. My meal was excellent. The omelete was thick and meaty, absolute perfection. The pricing was on point. None of us spent more than $6 for our meals.

They did it in 3 days, painting just the walls (no ceilings, no trims, no closets) for a price of more than $1,100. They did a very poor job. When I arrived at the property it was already dark with limited lighting, but I was able to immediately spot a numerous problems in their painting job. When I asked them to correct some of the major issues, they spackled the problematic spots and left for us to sand and paint. However Jeremy was firm that we must pay him. It was even worse the next day (at day light) when we saw what they have done - there were numerous spots where you can see the old paint. I also contacted Jeremy with a request to paint a closet and caulk the trim, items included in the contract, but he said it was a ""clerical error"" and he must get paid to do that.

Mild BBQ sauce is sweet and tangy and the Spicy is just that - not really hot, more spicy and very good. The sides are much better than I expected and stand-up as a compliment to the ribs. Definitely worth a trip as S.Jersey is kind of lacking in excellent BBQ.  This place is more of a take-out than site down, but the staff is very friendly and there a re few tables to eat at.

Long view - 
My son and I continue our quest for the penultimate BBQ in S. Jersey.  We had the Pork ribs and the Beef Ribs, with sides of Black-eyed Peas and Dirty Rice.  First, let me again say the side were very good.  Hearty and spicy dirty rice in a very traditional flavor is unusual to find this far north.  Black-Eyed Peas had a slight Dill flavor that complemented the peas.

The Beef ribs succulent with meat that just melted in your mouth. The Pork ribs were very meaty, but a little more chewy. No melt in your mouth on this one, you had to work at it.  My guess is that is was a busy Friday night and we got there later. Perhaps  the order we got, didn't have the same amount of time to slow cook?   Still very tasty and worth a second chance.

Reasonably priced with 2 half racks, 2 sides, sodas and fries coming in around $35.

I swear I won't ever use another painter. Jeremy is incredibly reliable, always gives a no fuss price quote and is a perfectionist to the T. My first transaction with GLS was with my parents kitchen. As a belated surprise anniversary present, I wanted to redo their kitchen without breaking my student budget. I submitted an inquiry on the website around midnight, and got an emailed price quote in hours. I spoke to Jeremy over the phone the next day on my way to work, but didn't get to work with him until a month or two later. (I blame my hectic schedule) He still kept his word, and was able to complete a complete cabinet transformation with a two man team in 2 1/2 days. It looks incredible, they did a fantastic job and my mom loves showing off her kitchen. Months later - I moved out of the nest and needed to repaint a small nook to brighten my two bedroom apartment. I didn't even bother shopping around for prices, Jeremy was literally a text away. I sent a picture of the space Sunday and he called me back with a quote and availability the same day. During this time, he had the birth of a newborn and still managed to show up at my apartment and knock the job out in an hour and a half tops. Committed? Yes. Professional? Yes. He provides input, brings the paint, every tool needed, and always goes above and beyond. I needed help changing out light fixtures, and he was down to help too.

The hostess and waitress were also talking about us, I think because I asked for plastics spoons, they pointed directly to our table while talking, and then when I made eye contact with them, they looked very uncomfortable. After the waitress came up a third time, to ask about our check, we just decided to leave. We were only in friendlys for no longer than a half and hour.

After he came back with the drinks he took our orders. 

Then got the food out fast. Once we finished eating he came over a few minutes later and said is there anything else I can get you? We told him no that's it. 99% of the time we are out and say that we get our bill. He just left and went to do other things. 

There were two people running the floor as far as I can see. So it was an older man and then this man that was about the same age as my boyfriend and me and were. So he had to be between 18-30. Then I see he take the next customers which was a family. He seats them.

Takes there drink order and then goes away and we are still waiting for our check this whole time! Comes back with their drinks and takes there order. I then get his attention and say could we have our check please. He gives it to us and goes off and does whatever. Comes back in a few minutes to take the check and money and says be right back with change. 

I watch him as he is doing something else and not giving us the change then I look away and he's back with the change. We left after that because we were done. We were also annoyed because my boyfriend had work at 3pm and we wanted to hang out a little more and go to target before he had to leave to get home to get ready for work which we got there at 12:30pm. By the time we said no that's it, it was 1:03pm. When he gave us the check and we got the change it was 1:15-1:16pm.

I came around 10 am it was quite peaceful. Tom was my nail technician for the morning, and yes I am always skeptical of a man doing my nails, because they try to move so fast and I alway end up hating my nails. I show him a simple picture of of a pink to nude ombré nail set on Pinterest. I unfortunately he and the owner told me that ""No one in the shop know how to do a Ombré"". That was wild to hear but I didn't judge so I trying to find just a plain color because that's all he said that he knew how to do. He lied to me and said they didn't have the Gel color Clear Pink, but behold the young woman next to him was putting on Clear Pink on her client.....‍. IT GETS WORST, so I did not want to argue due to language barrier. So I ask can you do a regular FRENCH TIP set for me. GUESSS WHAT......he said he doesn't know how to do it ‍. So now he is rushing me to make a decision, I'm getting super uncomfortable because of language barrier and I know for sure he is talk S*** about it. This is such a beautiful nail salon but rude service from TOM. I recommend to not come to this Nail Salon if you have certain nail set design in mind. They can ""ONLY DO ONE NAIL COLOR"". No designs . 

One Star for cleanliness of their nail salon. 

Oh wait let me also say this. Tom was so upset he made me sit in the small chairs that the technicians use to do Pedicures.

Booking Brigalias was easily the best decision I made during my entire wedding planning process. From the moment I stepped in there during their open house in October 2017, I knew this was my venue. The chapel alone was enough to make me fall in love completely. From day one of booking, they were helpful with answering my many questions and the day of the wedding they went above and beyond to make sure everything was exactly how I wanted. This included literally last minute uplighting changes and centerpiece changes. They did it all without batting an eye. Diana is the sweetest person ever and is truly committed to designing your wedding exactly how you envision it. Jessica was our bridal attendant and I couldn't have been happier with her. She made sure we had everything we needed (even things we didn't know we would need LOL) She graciously handled my very energetic toddler during important parts of the reception where we couldn't keep our full attention on him. She was hands down AMAZING! Brigalias also took extra care of the head tables as well. The food was seriously amazing. I still have guests tell me to this day that my wedding was one of the best they have ever been to, and the amount of food during cocktail hour and dessert alone is no comparison to any other place. Seriously, the entire room was filled with dessert! I wish I got to enjoy it myself LOL. Not just the food, the new Grand Ballroom is to die for and I am so thankful I was able to have my reception in it.

The restaurant is in a small shopping plaza with a chinese store, pizza place, daycare, liquor store,bank and laundromat. It's super easy to ride on by if you aren't familiar with the area.

This is more of a takeout place and has 3 tables, atm and a couple of soda coolers. Probably not the environment to sit down and eat.

In my opinion, a BBQ joint should just focus on BBQ. The menu has chicken fingers, turkey burgers, fries. Basically anything you'd buy from your local pizza shop. With the menu all over the place, the taste of bbq suffered. 

We threw away 9 out of 13 ribs because they were tough! Had no bite through and the sauce was wayyyyy too sweet. No smokiness at all. Tasted like the pre cooked ribs from a supermarket.

They were hired to stain new stair treads that were installed a week ago and paint the risers and sides.  After confirming a date to start the job, the owner (Jeremy) contacted me on multiple occasions to  tell me he was no longer available on the date we confirmed because of weather issues with his other job.  This caused a lot of reorganizing of my schedule. The bigger issue is that they experimented on my freshly installed stairs with a product they never used before and ruined the steps.  They applied the stain and just left it to dry as you would apply paint.  They never wiped the stain off during the process.  My stairs look as if someone painted them with chocolate brown paint.  In addition it was a very sloppy job.  There are paint brush strokes on every step. They are ruined!  They look completely different from the wood floors, rails, and posts.   I contacted the owner immediately. After coming out to assess the job he agreed that it was done incorrectly, said he takes full responsibility for it and the only solution would be to sand down the stain and polyurethane and start the process over but his company does not provide that type of service and he could give me $250 for my disappointment.  That doesn't cover it.   The material and labor to install the steps was over $1100.  They ruined them and refused to fix them.  Don't hire this company!

(mind you i thought this was a bookstore) after seeing that i didnt know if i should join in and also pleasure myself or cut my penis off and never leave my house again..i went with leaving immediately.. later i learned they use yahoo and craigslist to get men to enter the establishment and pay to access the back area where the management turns a blind eye to their homo-erotic love fest. pretty cool if youre gay but i am almost certain they wont have the copy of war and peace youre looking for",2014-08-09 18:14:56

By March 2020 we were nervous but hopeful that COVID would not impact our wedding 9 months away--we were wrong! We live in DC so it was not feasible to actually drive to NJ for updates, and lucky for us, we never had to. Rosemary answered every call, responded to every email, and kept us abreast on all the latest NJ restrictions for 9months!. She and Tina made arrangements for us to have our wedding ceremony while following COVID guidelines and restrictions. We were even offered by the team to have our reception outdoors on their venue, however, given unpredictable December weather, we humbly declined. Rosemary was fair and just with prices for just a ceremony and even allowed us to use the entire venue for photos. The day before our ceremony, we met with Paula who was also AMAZING! She made sure everything flowed smoothly the next day. At one point she was fixing the unstable crown on my head, making sure my cathedral veil was perfect for photos, and even (magically) removing a large make up stain from my white wedding dress!

I cannot comment on the other sauces as I always come back to the ranch. It's that good. 

I've had both the crispy tenders and the grilled. Both are very good, but I'm personally partial to the grilled. They're seasoned beautifully. 
I have only had the tenders. Not the sandwiches but my son had a salad and it was stacked with chicken pieces. 

I see a lot of comments about the fries. They def are a ""unique"" fry. Extra crispy almost darker brown in color. I love them, and love how they DON'T over salt as I have a child on a low sodium diet. 

They have sea salt grinders at the table to add more salt if you choose.  I can see how for take out this might be a pain. 

The dipping cup IS small, but if you do need more just ask. They don't charge you for it. 

I love this place, but the prices are a bit steep which is why I cannot give it 5. Too steep actually so PDQ is a treat.

This place has a much larger dining area. Upon arrival, all I could notice out front was a parking lot littered with cigarette butts and Primo order receipts. As I peer over to the gym next door, their lot is clean and free of such debris. The main register area looks very nice and the girl behind the cob tee was very polite. I ordered, paid and took a seat In the dining area. About 10 min later a young gentleman brings out my order. Very polite. 
As I'm eating, I begin to look around. 6 employees behind the counter just carrying on with conversation, one answering orders and one making them. The other 4 seem to be more interested in talking about their events from the prior evening. Not a huge deal, except, the floors in and around the tables in the dining area look as if the Cookie Monster went on a serious binge, all the tables were in desperate need of a wipe down, Napkin holders covered in dust as well as the window sills and trash receptacles. For such a nice and newly done location, this place is pretty dirty. Not really sure what the food pre area looks like but I'd hope they are paying a little more attention to that area since they seem to habitate there. 
The sandwich was made nicely but the roll was much more crusty than usual. One side was just a touch softer than a bagel chip. This leads me to believe they're not rotating their bread out of the brown paper they come in, after the rolls crust up a little. Or, they've over ordered and are freezing their rolls. Nice place but it appears they need may have a management issue.

My boyfriend and I were sat at a table in the middle of the restaurant and as I was looking around, every patron was still wearing there winter coats while eating their entrees.  Not cozy, but I would be fine if i got a good meal.  We started with the shrimp cocktail app which was obviously NOT fresh!  I have rarely ever been disappointed with shrimp, but this was difficult to stomach.  Next came our salads, I had house dressing which pretty much was just olive oil.  Then, the entrees were presented in a way that left little to be desired.  At first glance I could tell right away that the pappardelle pasta my chicken marsala was served over had probably been precooked and sitting out most the night as it was discolored and the texture was off.  My boyfriend's pasta with clams was the big loser of the night with a tasteless sauce of mushy pasta and overcooked chopped clams that you could shred like chicken.  YUCK!

I proceeded to do a bit of research on this particular establishment. Came to find, not to glowing a review on the place.. maybe a few would actually even return. Regardless, the certificate was bought and paid for.
Stopped by around 5:15pm or so.. seemed pretty slow at the time, understandably, considering the variety of rather similar restaurants just with the 10mile area. Grabbed a small advertisement at the hostess desk before being seated. This was for a Monday thru Friday 2 for $20 deal.. which was pretty limiting. Another daily deal they had advertised on the table, was an all you can eat for around $13. Neither of these deals, could we use with our gift certificate or any other coupon for that matter. 
So, my girlfriend and I just decided to order off the menu, and try to stay under $20 so we might have a shot at dessert without breaking the bank, tip of course included. She enjoyed the Portbella and Spinach Zazone, while I went for the personal pan size of the Bensi Special pizza. Both were good, certainly nothing to write home about, but not bad.

I quickly googled and came to the conclusion that they are similar to Chik Fil A. I went thru the drive thru and to my surprise there was a person there to take my order so no talking to a menu with speakers. I ordered chicken nuggets with their home made honey BBQ sauce and a coffee crunch shake. Everything seems to be made to order and very fresh. At first taste I felt the chicken was a bit bland and under seasoned but very fresh and juicy. Once I tried it with the sauce it was great. The sauce gives the chicken all the flavor it needs. The shake was very thick and delicious.  Taste like real ice cream was used not the stuff in the bag. Overall I enjoyed my meal. I'll go healthy next time and try one of their salads!!,2016-02-28 22:27:30

The appetizer was decent, we ordered the buffalo calamari, it was different. Can't even remember what the other appetizer was, but the soup was tasteless. I had the stuffed chicken... pomodoro I believe? NO IDEA, but it was TERRIBLE.. one of the worst things I've ever tried. They really should just take that off the menu. I couldn't even finish a quarter of it, so I decided to take it home and try to salvage it, but that was an even bigger fail. My boyfriend's dish wasn't good either, I forget what he had, but my parents really enjoyed theirs. My mother got the squid inked shrimp linguini I think, that was decent, and my dad got the special that day, a steak entree, he REALLY enjoyed that. Pretty much, I was pretty unsatisfied with my experience there.

I decided to give it another try before I made my judgement, and it was still just OKAY, nothing really changed. This time, I tried the buffalo calamari again hoping it would be better with the sauce on the side instead of smothered in it, but the calamari was still soggy, not crunchy or crispy at all really. It was tolerable though. I tried the squid ink linguini, which was just decent once again, my mother got a different steak dish, and it was really dry.

This place is a huge MEH for me. I wouldn't come here again unless I was forced to or something, maybe I'd go for something more simple, but other than that, nothing WOW here for me.",2010-08-18 07:40:02

I figured I wouldn't mind paying that since there are ""real ER doctors here"". My hospital ER co-pay is $100. I took a chance because I was uncomfortable with my son being so sick & it was a holiday weekend, it was a long 4 days & he had been sick on & off for about 4 weeks. I didn't want to wait another day to take him to his doctor, yet felt it was unnecessary to take him to ER. 

So he was examined by this doctor for all of 3 minutes. Understandable. My son had all the signs & symptoms of a nagging cough/cold/allergies with non threatening fever. But the issue that I had was that it was persistent. I heard him wheeze the night before and whatever was wrong with him was only getting worse, not better. 
The doctor told me to be patient, kids get sick, wait it out, yada yada. Fine. I left not feeling comfortable. I had the ""hypochondriac Mom"" label on me when I left. I was very frustrated. One, because I spent $70 to be told he was fine. Two, because maybe I just felt they could have done SOMETHING else.....

So of course since my instincts told me something was still wrong...I take him back to his pediatrician who then nose swabs him for bacterial infections that I've never heard of. Sure enough he tested positive for one & needed to be put on a strong antibiotic right away. 

I know doctors aren't perfect but for $70, for a place that wasn't crowded and especially for my 3 year old who has been sick but ""appeared"" to be in good spirits maybe a little more effort would have gone a longer way.

It's a Sunday evening and traditionally its friend chicken Sunday so I say why not give me a basic buttermilk chicken sandwich. I've always wanted chic fil a on a Sunday so this can't hurt. It takes another 5-6 minutes after I order for the people in front to move so I finally get my sandwich and it seems like there's some.type of imitation honey oozing out of the bun and the bun is slathered with butter. I'm clearly struggling because this is all going downhill fast. So I take a few bites and it's kinda good but I felt like I was eating mystery chicken meat. It was rubbery and chicken isn't rubbery unless it's over or undercooked. I finally just ditch the greasy shiny bun and ate the chicken. It was definitely lacking something.

I had never heard the name before so we did a quick google search from the car and saw that the menu was reasonably priced and just what we had in mind for a late Sunday dinner. 

It was busy but not overly crowded and we were seated right away. There were many entrees in the $12 to $20 range and they had all the normal Italian dishes and then some. I enjoyed the capellini with meat sauce and found it favorable to other places I've had the same dish. The bread and olive oil was good and the salad was about average. 

The service was very good with a very friendly but not overly friendly server. Her timing was very good and I noticed at least once that she was off in the distance, watching her tables ready to handle any need that came up. 

Not counting two glasses of wine at appx $7 each, the check would have been $36. Not too bad and about what I expected for this kind of place. I thought it was a good balance of quality and price.

We informed our server about the gift certificate and asked him if he wanted to take it now or with the check.  He said he would take it with the check and then asked for our order.  We had to spend $35 to have our $25 gift certificate activated, so we ordered the Weds night special which was 17.95/pp along with a glass of wine and a beer.  The special was a four course meal which was okay.  When it came time for dessert, which was supposed to be mini cannoli and ice cream, we were told that they were out of cannoli filling.  This was at 6pm on a Wednesday night.  Since we are not complainers by nature, we let that slide.  
Then it comes time for the bill.  We present the server with our gift certificate.  He takes it, comes back and tells us that we can't use the gift certificate with the special that we had ordered.  Since we had told the server in advance about the gift certificate and he said nothing about restrictions on the menu (nor did the certificate), I asked to speak to a manager.  The manager came over and informed us ""there's nothing I can do, the computer won't let me use it."". 
I have worked in a restaurant for a few years and I know the manager can write off anything on a check for any reason.
When we asked for the managers name, the server told us and stated ""he's only the manager on Wednesdays"".  (Which means they had no manager in house during this shift, which would account for why he couldn't do anything with the check).
I wrote an email to the corporate office and they were very gracious, sending me a $25 gift card to use at a future visit, which is fine, except I went to the Sicklerville location just the other day and it is closed (not sure if temporarily or for good- says ""Closed for Renovations"" on the door....)

Even though they have a full menu board outside like you find at any other fast food place, you sit there like an idiot to place your order until you see the small sign at the bottom that tells you to pull up to the window and place your order there.  OK, fine.  But the first window had no one there, and looked like it was closed with something pulled up to it (a mop or something).  I then pulled behind two other cars on the other side of the building that are waiting at a second window.  I waited while each of those cars placed their order and waited for it to be prepared.  Once it was finally my turn, the person at the window took my full order, asked me if I could wait a minute, and then came back and told me to circle the building again and go back to the first window.  Apparently that person had been in the bathroom (?), and she had been told she couldn't take orders at the second window (?).  Seriously, I was already there and had placed my order?!  So now after waiting 20 minutes already, I had to pull around and place the order from scratch.  Had it not been late, with other places starting to close, I would have driven off.

I don't blame the order takers.  I blame whoever was working management that shift who deemed it unacceptable for their employee to take the order, and just see it through with me after I had already been waiting there that long.  I've heard of fast food places asking you to pull up to bring you your order.  I've never heard of one that makes you circle around the building again and do the process all over again, because THEY weren't prepared.  Ridiculous.

Food was okay, although portions were pretty small for the prices.  Not the kind of place I would rave about to others.  And certainly not a place I would try to take advantage of the ""convenience"" of drive-thru.",2016-08-25 01:11:59

While the staff is very nice, professional, and friendly, the doctors are rude, in a rush, unprofessional, arrogant, and lack even the slightest bed side manner.
Just left after a visit for my husband. He has been experiencing extreme ear pain for 3 days- unable to sleep, in pain to eat, and his ear is not only red and swollen, but extremely sore to the touch. I thought it could be an infection, so i insisted we visit urgent care, just in case it was an infection, and because of the possibility it could spread to other parts of the body. Granted, I do not have a medical degree, however, i am still a reasonably educated person, and i do not appreciate having anyone treat me like an idiot, or an annoyance. We both work hard to be able to pay for the 'good' health insurance we have- which we rarely ever have to use. But the one time we do need to take advantage of it, we left feeling what a waste of time and our hard earned money it was.  What is it about doctors that make them feel so superior to the rest of the population? So arrogant that if you even think to question them or their diagnosis, somehow you become the asshole in the situation? The doctor touched and prodded a few places in and around my husbands ears and face. Spent all of three minutes doing that. Goes on to say how he is convinced my husband's problem is not in his ear, but in his jaw, and he would prescribe steroids to resolve it.  Continues with he must grind his teeth at night(he doesnt!). Half way into his half ass explanation, my husband interjects to say that he still thinks the pain is in relation to his ear, not his mouth- not in an argumentative way- but just to confirm, verify, and ensure all potential health risks have been explored. The doctor gets up, washes his hands, and exits the room, immediate upon my husband speaking. Doctor says nothing. Comes back in the room a few minutes later, says ""it was good to meet you"" and hands my husband a prescription for ear drops. When we begin to question him, why he left, where the steroid prescription is, and a couple other questions, the doctor just says ""im not here to argue with you- you think its your ear, i know its not, but here is your eardrops"". Okay asshole, we werent arguing with you, but even if we were, we pay damn good money into our health insurance, and if we want to dispute what you are saying, you get paid well enough to hear us out. We left urgent care with an unclear, uncomfortable, and unexplained diagnosis, and a prescription that we have zero confidence will work. The doctor was spiteful and didnt even finsh our conversation, or go the extra mile to prescribe both the ear drops and the steroids. Once we questioned him, the conversation was over, and was not going back to it. Simply said ""well come back when you know its not you ear and ill get you the steroids"". Really?! No one- under any medical condition, no matter how minor or severe, should be treated like this. We are human beings- we face medical concerns, and although we are not the experts, we are the patients and our voices should be heard. The medical industry has gone from a service to keep people healthy and safe, to  a business that is strictly about making money, and making friends with the big pharm companies, to in turn, make more money. greedy and rude.",2016-09-29 03:07:24

First let's start with the good.  The Buffalo Tender sandwich I got was VERY tasty.  I really enjoyed it.  A+ for that sandwich.  

However, the fries, I don't know if I just got this place at a bad time (they weren't crowded so I don't see how I could've gotten them at a bad time) or the people saying the fries are good are just being overly generous, but the ones I got were terrible.  Cold, tasteless, undersalted, many overcooked, I had to SALT the heck out of them to make them edible.  F- for the fries.

Price.  This place is ludicrously overpriced for the portion sizes.  Don't believe the images posted on this page, they're misleading because of the zoom used.  They're much smaller than they look in those pictures. My sandwich was 4.99 if I got just the sandwich by itself, and it's no bigger than a Wendy's Junior sized Hamburger.  It was basically the same size as a slider.   VERY disappointed with the relatively small sandwich.  For 5 bucks you'd think you'd get something that came on a bun the size of a Whopper from BK.  Not the case.  It's like HALF that size if not smaller.   Not happy with paying 5 bucks for a buffalo chicken slider. The person I was with got a 3 piece tender meal (which is 7 bucks and change...ludicrous), the total of our order was 16 and change.  Almost 17 bucks for 2 ""value"" meals is a little too pricey for a fast food joint. So they get a D from me for value.  This place needs to get over their identity crisis of thinking they are one of those super fancy restaurants that use the mindset of: ""tiny food for enormous prices"" and realize they're a fast food place. 

 Honestly I was debating between whether to give this place 2 stars or 3.  Since I really enjoyed the sandwich, as small as it was, I gave them a 3, despite their other failings.  

I won't be back unless they lower their prices, because I am not paying $5 for something that was as small as my sandwich was, no matter how tasty it was. Not when I can get a much larger sandwich elsewhere (chic-fil-a for example has MUCH larger chicken sandwiches for between 4 and 5 bucks).

The tenders are served hot and fresh with a wide variety of sauces. My favorite sauces are the honey mustard and the creamy garlic. The fries, however, can be inconsistent. Sometimes too salty, sometimes a bit bland but it doesn't really matter to me. The customer service is awesome, the workers are all very friendly.

The place was dead (that should have been our first red flag), with only one other couple eating.

Kids got nuggets and fries. All 3 orders were room temperature or below. They'd been sitting out for a while before served. With 3 orders of nuggets and two salads, and two sandwiches, they could have dropped a new batch in the fryer. 

3 of the nuggets had huge chunks of gristle in them which will ruin a chicken meal for just about anyone. 

The 2 salads were ordered, and they were incredibly bland, even with the added bacon. Shredded carrots were dried out. It seemed like a premixed bag that had been sitting around too long. 

The 2 honey chicken sandwiches we ordered were just okay. The chicken, although genuine real chicken (it's a sad reflection of the times, when this is a selling point), was good, but not great. The chicken itself was bland and didn't taste marinated or brined. It seems they rely too heavily on their sauces.

The egg roll was cold.  HUGE disappointment.  The wonton's themselves are good, but they consider a hot sesame sauce is entirely different than I experience at 99% of chinese restaurants.  It is accompanied with huge globs of peanut butter (huh?) and mounds of sesame seeds while the ""sauce"" is on the bottom.

It's back by my parent's house and according to them it's barely 2 months old. I've been there twice and I will continue to come back, recommend it, and bring my family because the food is just phenomenal. 

Let's start from the beginning which is the parking lot. It's right along a busy stretch of road with many places to go spend your money before or after a meal. We personally go to Creanies for ice cream afterwards. Step out of your car, walk up to the outdoor seating, and you'll see avcornhole set up which is very fun to play in the summer months. Walk in and you're greeted by an exceptionally nice eating area which I expect to see more in Philadelphia rather than South Jersey. Everything's clean, there are big glass windows which natural light comes flooding in through. 

My recommendation is to get the four piece chicken tenders, fries, and large drinkwith your choice of sauce (mine being creamy garlic sauce). It'll run you about $9 which is reasonable and you'll leave quite filled-mostly on fries because the tenders are small however, they are delicious. So give your order to the friendly staff (which makes for a great experience by the way), take a seat at the quality tables and chairs and in no time at all you'll be feasting.

The chicken is so fresh that I can't believe it's even possible. They hand bread it I believe each day and the end result is just excellent. The fries are nice and crispy and and none of the meal is too salty. That's a problem you'll run into going to cheaper place like Popeyes or Church's Chicken. The drink is large and refillable with all the Coke products you could want. My preference is to just go for the sweet tea.",2018-06-21 20:36:02

It's not. It's more like average.

I stopped in because my first restaurant choice for a sandwich and milkshake was inexplicably closed midday. I decided to eat in rather than eat in my car because it was hot outside.

When I walked in, there were four customers in line ahead of me. They didn't move too fast but I waited patiently. As person number four was called up, a manager popped over to the secondary register and called me up.

I started giving him my order, but he suddenly looked flustered, asked the first girl to take care of me, and scurried away. I was semi-confused but whatever. I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich, no tomatoes, and a strawberry milkshake.

Eventually the food came out (not exactly ""fast"" but I wasn't in a rush) and I found a seat. There were plenty of open tables but it wasn't long before a large family started hovering/staring nearby. Slightly bizarre.

The sandwich was alright but greasy like it had been soaking in oil. At least it wasn't dry! I wasn't a big fan of the milkshake. It tasted so artificial. Just not my thing.

Like there aren't three on the corners of every major intersection.""  But - we were pleasantly surprised: A north Jersey  chain restaurant that was serving really good Italian food, with large portions at a very fair price.

We would usually go once every couple of months and we were never disappointed but neither were we ever really ""WOWed"" - Good, reliable, enjoyable - all words that don't signal a ""Great Idea - Let's Go To Bensi!""

About a month ago, Groupon had a special: Buy a $25.00 certificate for $10.00 to Bensi.  We bought three, figuring we could just keep them in our back pocket for something different.

Last Friday we went and ordered the house salad (mixed greens with carrots, onions and olives - and it was very fresh) with dressing on the side and a Family Build a Pizza.  Terry ordered a grilled chicken, tomato and bacon pizza - and we have now discovered our FAVORITE PIZZA in Washington Township.

The crust is thin and crispy - and so flavorful; the tomato sauce has just a hint of sweetness; the cheese is outstanding and all the toppings are fresh, flavorful and applied with a heavy hand.  This pizza is to die for!

The complimentary bread is fresh and hot and comes with a dipping bowl of spiced Olive Oil and is quickly devoured.

Both times that we have gone recently - twice in 7 days if you're counting - the restaurant is not crowded and the wait staff are very friendly and attentive.  Both times saw us bring salad and pizza home for left-overs.

Trust me - you will not like it here; Stay home or better yet, go to Bertucci's which is in the same shopping center . . . I hate to have to wait for a table.

If only we could've bought 10 of those Groupon Coupons ;-).  Doesn't matter - we'll still be going back even when we have to pay full price!

Bensi gets 4 thumbs up from Terry and I.  Keep up the great work.  My only complaint - and it's minor - is that the Bensi bar does not have any beers on tap: Bottles Only.  What Is Up With That?

Recently that person hasn't been there during the lunch rush (when we usually visit).  We were always greeted with a smile upon entering, and our order was promptly taken.  However, during my last visit, I waited a very long time to place my order.  Maybe they are understaffed or their system needs to change; because somehow it was the responsibility of the person taking orders to also make milkshakes so we had to wait for milkshakes to be made before our order was taken.

I told him I was calling to see if they would still have my measurements in the computer since it was about a year ago and that I was interested in getting new rugs in two rooms.   He abruptly said to me I am busy right now with two customers I had to transfer you to somebody else and click he transferred me to another numberAnd transferred me to flooring.

The first time I got turkey wings with rice and gravy, Mac and cheese and ""candied yams"". Turkey wings were ""slimy"" aka not baked correctly so they felt boiled vs baked but flavor was decent, Mac and cheese was on the drier side but ok, but the yams were super bland - basically boiled potatoes with a light sugar syrup.  On my second visit this evening, this was the final straw!! I got BBQ short ribs, Mac and cheese, greens, potato salad and banana pudding. Oh man, where do I start?? Ribs were tender but basic as hell except for the nasty sauce that was sparingly used to cover them. They were far from BBQd and had zero seasoning. The Mac and cheese was super dry and had too much onion powder and pepper in it - and I love both seasonings, but it was just off here.  The potato salad was somehow a little sweet but the texture was way wrong - more like mashed potatoes dressed like potato salad. The greens were had an oily liquid that again was bland and seemed like only salt water. Finally, the banana pudding was artificial banana flavored pudding with a few cookies thrown in. Such a disappointment!! I only took a few bites of each and the rest is sadly going in the garbage.

First off I go to this Home Depot to pick up some wood for a project that my father-in-law is doing, I stand in front of the cutting Center hoping to find someone who works there. When I don't see any employees I start to walk around and find one. I asked the man in the orange apron to help me, he proceeded to tell me that it's not his department and I should go find someone who works there. I informed him that I have already looked in that department and could not find someone to help me cut the wood, and ask him if you would kindly call for someone to help me. He shrugs and says fine! I hear him over the intercom calling for an associate to come help cut some wood. After standing in front of the cutting Center for about another 15 minutes I finally get on my phone and call the the exact same Home Depot I'm standing in. I informed the customer service representative on the phone that I am standing in their Home Depot after hearing the announcement over the intercom and I'm still waiting for someone to come help me. She puts me on hold and I see a man who's been standing in a orange apron pick up his phone, he turns and looks at me and starts walking towards me. The customer service representative gets back on the phone and I asked her if she called someone, she says yes and I inform her but I'm looking at the man who she just called and watched him walk back and forth about four times with nothing to do. He approaches me and informs me that the cutting saw is broken. Honestly would have been nice to know if there was a sign posted up I would have just taken the wood with me and cut it myself. That's not even the worst part of my trip to Home Depot. Later on I had to return because I needed to replace my garage door locks. Standing in front of the garage door lock display I'm trying to figure out which lockset I need to purchase. A young man wearing the Home Depot Orange apron precedes to stand in front of me and help a young lady find a garage door opener. Without an apology and without any disregard for any customers around him he perceives to help the woman as I have to go around both of them to look at the parts that I need. And no point in time did this associate realize that Not only was I in need of help but that he was blocking the entire section. I vent hear him ask her if she needs anything else and she says she is in need of Halloween decorations. He perceives to tell her that if she wants he has some pumpkins already carved at his place. Are you freaking serious?! There is a time and a place to get somebody's phone number or to hit on them, and while you're working at Home Depot and ignoring the other customer who is standing there trying to get around you to look at some parts and obviously needs help is not the place and time for that!!

I went the first time to check out the soul food. I agree with other reviewers who say that it needs a ""little work."" The mac and cheese and collard greens could use more seasoning. At first, I thought maybe they didn't cook the greens with any meat since I didn't find any bits in my serving, but their menu says they use smoked turkey. The fish pieces were of nice size. But again, the breading could use more seasoning. It is as if they use just plain breadcrumbs instead of, say, Italian breadcrumbs like mom used to use. The fried chicken wings were good. One thing this place has going for it is its pricing. It is definitely one of the cheaper soul food places around. So I will come here if I am trying to watch the budget. But if I can treat myself, I will go to Ms. Sweetea's or Aunt Berta's. I went back a second and third time to try the hibachi. The hibachi shrimp and chicken is very good. The teriyaki sauce gives it a slightly different taste than shrimp fried rice from a Chinese takeout place. It comes with mixed vegetables (carrots, broccoli, cabbage ... which I am not a fan of, but there is so little cabbage in it, that I can deal with it). The next time I go, I want to try their pork chops. The people running it appear nice and friendly. It would be nice if there was space where you could eat there. They have a table set up outside, and there are stools at the counter. (Does that mean you can eat there? I am not sure. It might just be for sitting while waiting for your order.)

So, we called ahead, was told it would be 20 minutes, and I arrived 25 minutes after placing my order.  I was disappointed to hear we could not give payment over the phone, so we could just run in and out.  I would have ordered online, but we had a coupon.  So, even though I did not want to have to spend any extra time inside, keeping social distancing in mind, I went in to pay and pick up my food.  I was surprise to find a busy lobby and continued to try and keep socially distant to others, taking about 10 minutes to pay.  And then to my surprise, another 15 minutes waiting for my order.  So, from my phone call, it took 50 minutes.  I should have left and sat in my car, and informed them to call me when the order was ready, but I truly kept thinking, I must be getting my order any minute.  No information relayed as to what the hold up was or even that there would be a longer wait.  4 people making the hoagies.  I have no idea what the problem was.  While the food here is great, I think the restaurant needs to have an accurate pick up time, and if for some reason this delays, communicate with your customer and give them the option of sitting in their car. You can call their cell when ready.  I wanted to support my local business, but I was very upset with the situation.  PAY ATTENTION PRIMO...... and change your practices!!!!",2020-03-19 00:32:47

I also understand that doctors are overworked and tired.  I think, though, that when you are suffering and vulnerable that you should be treated with dignity and respect.   

I visited AlantiCare because I was having trouble breathing last Wednesday.  I had had a long and stressful day and was exposed to many allergens (including my sister's cats) and lots of emotional stresses.  Yes, I came into urgent care at 10:30 and, yes, they close at 11.  The doctor, Susan Hinchliffe, treated me like an utter moron.  She rolled her eyes at me multiple times which is unprofessional, to say the least.  She focused on the fact that I had been to my sister's house (with cats!) like I was some dumb piece-of-crap.  She told me not to go to my sister's house in the future and suggested ""meeting her for lunch"".  My little sister is pregnant and suffering through a rough-patch, you better believe I will go to my sister's house you vile-beast-woman.  She prescribed me freaking prednisone immediately, which I expressed reservations about taking.  I don't think the first course of action should have been prescribing me a strong steroid with iatrogenic side-effects. She dismissed my concerns.  

Hey, Dr. Hinchliffe, look-up  the word ""iatrogenic"" it means ""of or relating to illness caused by medical examination or treatment.""--that's right, I have an advanced degree, too!  My degree is in anthropology and one of my specialties is medical anthropology and the treatment of vulnerable patients.  Maybe you should take a course in that and learn how to talk to people with respect when they are going through a stressful time and feel vulnerable.  Maybe you should take MY COURSE.  

Anyway, my visit cost $100 and I was left with a bottle of prednisone and a bad taste in my mouth.  Thanks for the memories.",2016-08-31 15:39:45

OjDfvtopAf6xJQOGrF7w-w,5f1qyG3RFKXV03mkBukkiw,b7UYQZ5-9-pNG6UgJPiaJA,1,1,0,0,"My parents, at my suggestion, went to the Washington Twp Home Depot to replace the carpet in their new home. The carpet is in their great room which is half laminate and half carpet with existing laminate transitions separating the two right in the middle of the room. The measure was done correctly and my parents purchased the install.
 My mother inquired at the point of purchase about replacing those transitions and was told ""No problem"" the installer will bring them out and take care of it. I guess ""No problem"" means something different to Home Depot. 
The installer called to schedule the install and my mother asked again about the transitions and the installer said they only install the traditional metal transitions. Why would she want metal transitions down the middle of her room? 
 So I called Home Depot and again we get ""No problem"" just bring in a color sample of your laminate floor to match and you can buy the additional transitions and as long as you have them at the location, the installer will install them. So, we make sure we go back to Home Depot right away to make sure we have the materials in time for the install the next week. The salesperson pulls out the measure determines how many transitions we need and helps choose a matching color to the sample we provided. I noticed that the strips would need to be cut..the salesperson says ""No problem"" the installer will have a saw to cut them on the site.
 At this point something didn't sound right. I never knew a carpet installer to carry a miter saw with him for a carpet install. So. I called our installer to give them a heads up about the materials and I was told again that they did not do this. Home Depot was contacted who then said we needed to pay an additional $175.00 for the installers to install the transitions they sold me just the day before. So what was supposed to be included in my original install price- now was costing me an additional $65.00 in materials and $175.00 in labor. 
So our options per the assistant manager, Kim was to pay or cancel the install. I got corporate involved and got the labor reduced to $75.00- which I assume was cost.
 The day of the install, the installer advises my parents that the salesperson did not sell us enough materials. The store had no one to run us out an additional transition so my father, unfamiliar with his new area had to run back to the Home Depot and PURCHASE another transition for his job.
The money wasn't the issue- it was the fact that if we did not continually inquire about our install procedure - we would have never received what we were promised. I understand that my contract has a clause for unforeseen additional costs but transitions are not unforeseen and even if it was missed on the initial quote- it was repeatedly mentioned during the 3 subsequent conversations with the store employees. Now as a prior Home Depot employee, when did selling the whole job leave the vernacular? Where did the times go when you stood by your word and when shown to be in the wrong- doing what is right for the customer was paramount? Heck- when did retailers no longer want to sell the extras? The worst the customer could say is ""No"" and the best is you increased your per customer ticket.   And people wonder why brick and mortar retailers are slipping away-  when you no longer care about the customers or the bottom line, distinction is the only result.

Update-  The store called to advise that there was a balance due on the project and inquired how things went-  they were told the whole story but offered no resolution.  They did admit that we were told the wrong information from the point of sale and through out the project.  The also acknowledged that if they hadn't sold enough carpet or labor- the customer would not be financially responsible.  So how is that they didn't sell the right materials or labor but since it wasn't carpet we had to pay for their mistake?

Second Update:  Customer Care has not bothered to return 3 emails requesting assistance in over 1 month. When My parents tried to resolve their issue at the store level - the store threatened to send their $38.00 balance due to collections.",2018-04-20 13:05:13

The manger and bartender, assumed that he and I were both intoxicated, which we were not. I later explained this to the bartender Sonia, who showed much sympathy and was very apologetic, however when explaining the situation to the General Manager, Michelle she was not. She claimed that we were intoxicated, and that she had the right to not serve anyone she felt necessary. She did not want to hear that he was visually impaired; she was extremely rude and offered an apology in a rude fashion. We both are very upset about how we were embarrassed in this establishment and will never go back. I am currently in contact with the National Federation of the Blind to see what further action can be taken against this restaurant. At this point in time, nothing can be done to rectify the situation. A decent apology and understanding of a disability was all we wanted at first, but nothing can help the emotional damage that has be done by this establishment.",2012-05-07 13:14:35

I made my order online because it is a fifteen minute or twenty minute drive and figured it'd be ready by the time I arrived.   The order was placed at 11:41.  I arrived about 12:05....my ticket said that delivery pick up time was 12:26.....I patiently waited all that time realizing I was early.  The place was jam packed and they wanted to have the line start where the only opened door was.  Meanwhile, outside it starts pouring rain and the counter girl locks all the doors except for the furthest door.   No signs on the doors...just people outside getting drenched as they try one door...then the next....then they finally get in after the third try.  I digress....so my order was not ready until 12:48.  EFFING ridiculous.  Granted it was 4 Italian hoagies, nothing special but there were people walking in the door, ordering then walking out with their food as I waited and watched.  

Don't PRIMO's build the orders as they come in?  The ""chef"", ""cook"", or whoever the eff he was (a big f@t dude) whining like a little b!t(h about pick-up times...Meanwhile, it is 22 minutes passed my effing pick up time!!! Ya J.O.!

PRIMO'S this is a failure to be prepared for a huge promotion YOUR company ran today.  If you're only going to offer $5.99/primo sized: Italian, Turkey and cheese or Ham and cheese, at least have the lunch meat PRE EFFING SLICED so that you can slap it together.  Building a hoagie isn't rocket science ya big dummy ""chef"" ""cook"" ""sandwich assembler"" ""fudgepacker"".  The people were not social distancing by six feet but on top of one another.

I ordered penna alla vodka (which was delicious) and he ordered chicken marsala. When his dish came out, it looked like they had poured a jar of brown gravy over a piece of chicken and some canned mushrooms, but I didn't say anything. As soon as he took the first bite, he pushed the dish aside. It wasn't good. I tried it for myself and he was right. It had absolutely no flavor. He politely sent it back and told the waiter it just wasn't good. We were in a hurry so instead of waiting for another meal, we split mine. When the waiter brought the check to us, the Marsala was still on it! We asked if he could take it off and he told us his manager doesn't do that but he'd ask. When he came back, the Marsala was off the check, but we were charged for the side of spinach (that comes with the Marsala) and a SHARING charge since we split my meal. If I were a restaurant owner or chef, I'd personally want to know what was wrong with a dish I presented and would try to accommodate the customer as best I could.

Jersey a couple of years ago and one of the hardest transitions I had to make... was finding a new hair dresser.  I have probably tried at least half a dozen, if not more, hair salons in the S. Jersey area and finally found a place that I am willing to go back again and again.. Cutting Edge Times Salon in Sicklerville.

I had just bought a house in the area and my new grocery store was located in the same plaza.  There was a Best of SJ 2009 sign as they were voted for Best Women's Haircut, so I thought I'd give it a try.

I called and explained what I was looking for - someone who does good color and can handle my thick, wavy/curly hair.  The receptionist recommended a stylist and I booked my appointment.  I walked in a few days later and was pleasantly surprised... the staff was friendly and the decor was welcoming yet relaxing.  Not too bad for salon in a shopping plaza!  My stylist was Cindy and she was phenomenal.  She took at least 10 mins just talking to me about my hair - what I want or don't want, how much I'm willing to spend today and on upkeep, how much time I spend styling my hair, and how much time I have in the morning.  She really got to know me and what I wanted (or didn't want) and came up with a game plan.  I ended up getting an all over color to tone down some of the blonde and a hair cut to fix some of the choppy layers I had gotten from a previous salon.  She took really good care of me - I was offered water or coffee on numerous occasions, and the shampoo girl did a great job... I almost fell asleep!   When it was time to leave, I didn't faint at the counter when I was given my bill... finally, I had found a place that does a great job at a reasonable price I can afford!

I've been back 3 times since my first visit and the last time I did a more drastic change to my color.  Cindy did such a good job that I've gotten countless compliments on how pretty the color looks!  I def recommend this salon to anyone who mentions they are looking for a new place or don't know where to go...  They do it all from the keratin treatments to waxing to hair cuts to nails.  Their website is great, it has profiles of all the stylists and specials/coupons to use, even if you are a returning customer.",2010-01-11 01:02:17

Comes in a huge portion and cooked precisely right. Sandwiches here are always huge. They have a $12.95 early bird special Sunday - Thurs that includes soup and salad and a huge choice of entrees. My husband usually orders some kind of seafood, and it is always fresh.

This Saturday, my family had an event at this venue. The air conditioning did not sufficiently cool the hall. Needless to say, our guests (including the guests of honor mother and father to be) were dripping sweat and completely uncomfortable. We all suffered through with a smile, including their two catering staff who graciously sacrificed their box fan that they had in the kitchen to some of our guests. 

However, when my mother asked for compensation for the discomfort (discount on the thousand plus she spent on this venue), we were told there was nothing they could do for us. They said the air conditioning units (which were residential units not commercial) were battling the heat. 

I just want the owner of this venue to know that my boyfriend was made physically ill by the conditions in this venue. When we returned home he threw up and had to sip water and sit directly in front of the AC unit to get back to normal. We had elderly and children in these conditions as well. PLEASE replace your three residential units as soon as you can. 

Be advised if you have an event schedule at this venue for the summer, you will probably be extremely uncomfortable!

My mothers comments from my Facebook review:
I have to agree. I received other calls from family who stated they felt over heated and stayed as long as they could. They graciously said it wasn't our fault and otherwise had a good time. But there was no dancing. My brother had to leave early because he was not feeling well and other people were trying to get through. I saw another family member with an ice pack on his neck. Could the cater not have known the air wasn't working properly and moved us to their newer facility? This is our first grandchild and we wanted this to be a joyful memorable moment. I am sadden that my guests had to suffer in this manner. Yes we ate and took food home but that is what we paid for. What we did not receive was a comfortable air conditioned venue which without saying should have come with the price.",2016-08-15 17:07:46

Everything is good here. And it's fresh which is something to be said for Asian fooderies located in shopping centers.

Any time you find a place like this you pray the restaurant gods won't shut it down. You also pray they won't make it impossible to get a table which, more often than not nowadays, is the case. Even ordering take-out can have you waiting an hour. They are very short-staffed and however quick they move it seems like they can't keep up. But if you can get there before the masses descend (by 6) you'll feel like you did when your bf/gf said ""let's go steady.""

That being said, Wild Ginger is more or an Asian fusion kind of place, taking a little from Japanese, Thai, and Mandarin cuisines to offer a nice mix of offerings.  

We find this place worth frequenting, but most likely because of its location in relation to our house (within 7 miles).  They do several things well, but don't expect a strong Thai representation.  

The spring rolls are crisp, light, and have a great flavor (not too greasy either).  The pad Thai is okay, but lacks authenticity.  The Tom Yum soup is pretty good, but doesn't have a whole lot of kick (not enough lemon grass).  

The service is usually top notch.  They are very attentive and the Jasmine tea is really good.  They have a neat take on green tea ice cream, which is definitely worth sampling.

Badfish will ruin your day maybe week..... Acora should be very clear and not gooey or syrupy. . It should have a fresh salt water taste and not too salty going to a better restaurant before you go to an all-you-can-eat and try different fish and learn the taste don't be afraid to smell your fingers before you put that fish in your mouth...

Another 20 minutes pass and as I'm about to call back and tell them we don't even want it anymore, a different delivery guy hands me a completely cold pizza with a ""Sorry, I got lost."" It took 50 minutes and they didn't even re-make the pizza? And of course all of the other food that had arrived the first time was cold now too. We really just couldn't believe it.

This whole process had taken so long that our 9 year old finally was able to eat his (cold) dinner at 9pm, then had to go directly to bed. We had waited so long that we weren't even really hungry anymore, but heated up the pizza and wings anyway (pushing our dinnertime to 9:30) to discover that we waited an hour and a half for extremely mediocre, flavorless food. The pizza was soggy and wet. The sauce on the wings was decent, but the wings themselves were already overcooked and tough, and reheating them only made them worse. The onion rings we'd ordered came in the first delivery, but were burnt, so we couldn't reheat them without ruining them more.

The funniest part of this extremely aggravating night was that the restaurant called just after the cold pizza was delivered to check and see if it arrived. I said yes, but it's not even remotely warm anymore. The girl on the phone said okay, well next time you order from this number you'll have a credit for the pizza. Um, thanks, but I'll never be ordering from this place again.",2012-09-25 13:26:12

We had about an hour to kill before a movie, so we decided to check this place out instead of Tony Lukes (what a mistake). We were immediately seated at 7:05. Our orders were taken minutes later - I opt for the lone Thai item on the menu, the Pad Thai. Wife goes for the garlic chicken. Easy enough, right? While gazing around the restaurant admiring the finishes and nice sushi bar, the waiter brings me a can of soda. Its 2011 - a good deal of money was obviously spent inside this place, and yet they opt to sell/serve soda by the can. Amazing. 

Lets not dwell on the canned soda though, as we came here to eat. Chinese food is historically quick to prepare and serve (or deliver) - isnt it always ""teh/fiteen minees"". Here, it took over half an hour to get our food, which is unconscionable for 2 people, with a dining room that wasnt even full. The portions were generous, Ill give em that, but there was nothing really special or memorable about the dishes. Certainly not the best Pad Thai I ever had, rather bland. The wife's garlic chicken was garlicky. Hooray. 

In the end, we had to wolf down our food and cash out asap so we could make our 7:50 movie (which we didnt). Wish we went to Thai Chili 88 instead.",2011-10-16 20:13:36

I really enjoyed their Thursday Prime Rib Dinner (w/two sides) Special ($15) one evening when I was craving a home-cooked type of meal and not my usual cheese steak or Italian hoagie.  The girls from my work order from Villa Deli religiously every single Friday and have been for years.  

I've lived in Sicklerville for years and just recently discovered Villa Deli in the past year (no clue how it got by me all of this time!).

We ordered two plain pizza pies. You'd assume such a simple task as that would lead to consistent/decent pizza. Unfortunately, it was a waste of money in my opinion. The pizza was just not good. The cheese and sauce combo were simply off. Despite just out of the oven, once the cheese hardended/cooled a bit, it became gummy and when you bite into the slice, the cheese would all come off.

She should definitely be fired for being so rude. I arrived (at exact time stated) the food was not ready & I had to wait 12 minutes for my food.

I know this may seem petty or even fickle but one thing I really dislike about restaurants, in general, is inconsistency.  As my previous post stated, I have been ordering from NJP for close to 9/10 years.  Latley, I've been ordering delivery.  There  have been time periods where I haven't ordered  in a while and then times where we have ordered 2x in one week.  However, my most recent experiences with NJP has left a bad taste in my mouth.

Whenever I order (usually a mushroom cheesesteak), I order a side of jalapeno poppers.  Now, some restaurants include a dipping sauce (i.e. marinara) and some don't.  Within the last few months, whenever I've ordered delivery, I've noticed that sometimes I get it, and sometimes I don't.  One time, I spoke with the owner and he said that a side of marinara DOES come with the poppers but sometimes the staff forgets to pack it.  Then whenever I asked to make sure that the sauce does come with the poppers sometimes I would be charged for the sauce and sometimes I wouldn't.  The most recent experience is what totally turned me off.  When I ordered delivery, I specifically asked, does sauce come with the poppers?  If not, I'll pay for it.  The nice girl who took my order specifically said, YES, sauce comes with the poppers.  My delivery came.  No sauce.  I called back.  She said, oh yeah, we don't give sauce with the poppers.  She didn't even apologize for not providing the sauce.  How did the information change within ONE HOUR??  I even said I would have paid  for the sauce but no sauce.

I guess this may seem petty but what irks me the most is that I specifically asked the owner a few months ago and the cashier girl when I placed my order.    Consistency in service and taste are the 2 things I value the most at a restaurant.  But because of this, I guess I'll be getting my cheesesteaks in Philly (by my job) and then reheating once I get home.",2012-04-23 02:33:24

Plus we like to support Black owned businesses. First of all we weren't even greeted when we came into the restaurant. It was an awkward atmosphere. Maybe some music playing in the background would have helped out a bit... something as small as that would have made a difference. We ordered one of the family meals with fish and chicken. The fried chicken and fish at best was mediocre. Barely any seasoning and was bland. The greens were wayyyyy too salty. Also the mac & cheese didn't look fresh. It looked like it was reheated from the previous day or maybe days ...who knows. The mac & cheese wasn't too bad so I made do. Only thing that was delicious was the cornbread and yams. We had food leftovers from the night before so I decided to take a little to work. I even was telling my coworker about the place and even considered giving them another chance despite not being pleased about my first experience. I figured maybe I can order something different next time. Well unfortunately there will not be a next time because after having some of the leftovers for lunch not even 20 mins went by and I got nauseous. Needless to say I threw up the food.

Now, on to the food. It is decent, nothing special. Never had a bad meal there, I just do not like the portions. Dinners do not come with salads and the portion size is small.

Then he said I will make a fresh one for you.

Due to the confusion My husband cancelled his Stromboli but I kept my penne vodka. However, my husband was so disappointed with the service that we immediately called back and cancelled the order in total. The manager literally called us back five minutes later yelling and screaming about how we are ridiculous for cancelling our order and literally demanding us to come get the food. It was only five minutes yet he claimed the food was already prepared even though prior to that call we were told it would take 20 minutes!

THIS place tried telling me to get a gel manicure, that simply painting a French would require me drying for 15-20 mins before the gel top. I told them I wanted it done the way I always did, they literally debated with me (the paying customer) for minutes. They finally did what I wanted and proceeded to make me dry for 20 mins. I asked them what was different about their gel then others, since I had never experienced this before. They basically called me a liar and said what I typically get isn't possible.

I've had Jamaican Food from many different places including the ""best"" ones in Philly (Ron's, Quality, etc...).  NONE of these places come remotely close to the taste of the food you get from Flava.  I sometimes drive from an hour away to get their food.  I usually get the jerk chicken or curry chicken platters with rice and peas and Mac.  

I can't say enough about the jerk chicken.  It's the absolutely best I've ever had!  And the best part is, like authentic Jamaican jerk chicken should be he doesn't slather bottled pre-made jerk ""BBQ sauce"" on the chicken like every other Jamaican restaurant does.

It burns me up when I order a jerk platter from somewhere and I open it and it's bottled jerk BBQ sauce poured on top of baked chicken.  You don't get this at Flava!  You get homemade jerk sauce that the owner makes himself!  I often ask him for the recipe when I go but he will never give it up lol.

Now onto the curry chicken.  Absolutely amazing curry flavor!  It's not powdery like some places either.  The curry is not to strong and not too weak.  He'll add some jerk sauce to it for heat if you ask him to (which I always do).

The curry goat is equally amazing. And lastly, his platters are very clean.   When you open the box, the chicken is cleanly cut and placed in the biggest part of the box,, the rice and peas look (and taste) like perfection and is placed in it's own spot, as is the mac.

Kudos to Flava!

I told him eh I'm not feeling any of these colors wish you would have showed me them before you did this... I pick a iridescent glitter and a pretty blue color. They are both very dull! You can't even tell it's glitter. He says oh I'll put some glitter on top don't worry. Glitter is now on top and it's rough...he takes the alcohol and wipes my nails down I say no top coat he says no it will dull the glitter. TF!? So he puts lotion on me and says $40 even. Wait what?! You said $35 earlier he said well it was $5 for the glitter. Oh you mean this rough glitter with no top coat? Why didn't you say it was going to be extra? You suggested this. He then says well it's usually $10. Oh really?! For no top coat rough glitter. I should have stuck to my guns and stayed away! I wish I would have had time to wait for the new salon I usually go to.

So since I couldn't that one star is for the convenience they offer by having a drive thru - that is it... I ordered from this spot three times. The 1st time I ordered curry chicken, cabbage, rice & peas. For me the flava wasn't all that but I still ate the food since I am not one to waste my money plus it was near the end of the day so I thought maybe I had gotten the end of the pot. And yes the portions were very very small. 2nd time I ordered I had the curry chicken, string beans, rice & peas. This time I asked the owner Pete if he could put some gravy over the rice and he said let me give u some gravy from the jerk chicken it will spice it up plus give u some heat (instead of using hot sauce) I said ok. Tasted the food and the jerk sauce had improved it 100%. It was now very edible. Portions were very small. 3rd time was yesterday. I ordered curry chicken string beans, rice & peas. I received cabbage, curry chicken and rice & peas and a strip of corn bread. I didn't complain about the cabbage but i did ask for the jerk sauce and the owner was very rude and argumentative and he was like u want some of the gravy on your rice mind you it's a water based gravy from cooking the chicken almost like chicken broth. It's gonna cost you an extra $.69. I said are you serious. He got so loud and said yes u pay here like anywhere. Whatever you ask for I charge for. I was completely done. I got home and threw that whole platter in the garage and never ever again will I order from that place. If I don't have my children in the car more words would have been exchanged and I would have gotten a refund...

So one day I asked my boyfriend to go there and sit down so we did...BIG MISTAKE! when we walked in they greeted us and sat us down. Asked us if we wanted anything to drink we both requested water with lemon they brought us water in very dirty cups (that's when we should've just got up and left) but we just asked the waitress if she could give us water in to go cups instead. She looked at us weird and said alright another lady comes over after our waitress went over starring us and speaking to someone. The lady took our food order that we asked for in to go player as well she replied ""to go platter you can't sit here and dine in if you DONT TIP...dine in is for Tipping only"" I for one normally would've just got up and left but still being settled I replied yes we are going to tip because we are dining in. She walks away literally all the Asian workers that are there are currently starring at me and my boyfriend as if we looked like aliens speaking their language with no care in the world. They bring our food out with the receipt right away. Which was very rude...so as me and my boyfriend starts to eat the lady waits about 4 minutes before she comes over (we are still eating clearly) and say are you guys done trying to take the bill that we hadn't even looked at or paid yet because we were still eating right there I was so fed up. I said pay this lady and let's go so my boyfriend paid and tipped and we just left our unfinished food and everything.

Ordered pad thai and told 3 times the cashier i need spicy .... spicy and spicy. Usually wheh you say spicy that means you need extra spicy.

After saying that what i got is a mild pad thai whith hot oil on the side and when we called them they had an attitude with not accepting its thier mistake... at the end with the attitude they told my wife that bring it back we will give you another one .... seriously you are not doing us a favour by giving us another meal with your attitude

Went there on a weeknight with 2 adults and 2 kids with only about 4 tables of guests in the restaurant at the time. We had been here several times for lunch but never dinner. Server was disinterested and never cracked a smile the entire time. He had to be called over multiple times because he rarely checked on us. We ordered from the sunset menu, which included soup or salad, entree and bread for $14.95. All of our food came out at once, soup, bread, entrees so we had no time to enjoy our courses or feed our kids. Food was okay at best, most of it was bland and needed to be doused in grated cheese for any semblance of flavor.

Here's the part that really made us upset. My kids wanted ravioli and meatball for dinner, but the kids portion was $6.25 and only included 3 average sized ravioli (no meatball, that would have been extra), which was a bit too small for my kids and overpriced for that small amount of food. We opted to get them the adult sized portion from the sunset menu and have them split it assuming this would be a much larger portion and included meatball and a cup of soup for $14.95, which mind you is more than the cost of 2 kids meals . The meal came out split into 2 dishes, although I didn't request it that way, and included 3 ravioli and a half a meatball on the same plate, so essentially we paid about $3.50 more for a single meatball and a cup of bland soup. Okay, shame on me I should have asked about the quantity and not assumed. But THEN the bill comes and they charged me an additional $3.50 sharing charge! So $18.50 for 6 average run of the mill ravioli and 1 meatball!!! I had already felt foolish for ordering the adult portion, but this was just greedy and insulting, especially when we weren't informed of a sharing charge by Mr. Personality!

Hey folks, take a look at what your customers are saying about you!!! We're not impressed and it's affecting your pockets! Customer service is an easy and FREE upgrade to your business. From someone who spent 8 Years in the industry from bus boy to manager, you need to get control of your staff. As for me, I don't turn the other cheek when I'm taken advantage of the first time.

Even though we call the order in and wait an extra five minutes before they say it will be done I'm still always standing there at least ten minutes waiting. Everyone but the younger guy at the counter and the younger blonde who works the counter is just plain rude. You smile at them or greet them and they just scowl back like they hate life. I've never been somewhere where you feel like you're inconveniencing them by being a customer more than here. Icing on the cake lately has been the fact that every time I've been in in the last month they are openly bad mouthing their customers which is unacceptable in my mind. The food has also been so inconsistent lately. Sometimes it's phenomenal and other times the macaroni salad is watery or the croutons are horrible etc etc. I'm really hoping they start to pick up their game and don't turn into one of those places that gets so popular they forget about customer service and food quality.The only reason I'm even giving then two stars because they really do have the best cheese steak I've had,2014-08-06 15:56:17

This is a take out or delivery soul food spot. Located right off Sicklerville road- the area has a lot of small stores m, kind of a mini hub for locals.

The pros: 
Customer service is amazing! The staff is super sweet and welcoming.

You can tell they take pride in the quality of the food- the veggies are fresh and they are excited to help you out.

Prices are not too bad (check out the pic of the menu)

The lemonade is delicious

Cons:
The food just doesn't taste all that great. The first time I went I got crab cakes, yams and macaron n cheese. The crab cakes, although made with real crab meat, were too salty. The macaroni was missing something and a bit dry l. The yams were pretty good- a bit too sweet for my liking but definitely nothing to turn away.

Because I wanted to like this place so much I decided to go back and get my brother a platter as well (maybe I was being too harsh). This guy can can eat with the best of them and he just was not impressed. He got the chicken and shrimp combo with yams and macaroni. He liked the shrimp and yams but was happy he didn't pay for the meal....

I got the whiting and chicken- the breaking was good but it had no real seasoning to it. 

I am broken heartedly not going to be returning to this place... Maybe to pick up a bottle of lemonade but no food.",2016-04-08 18:06:28

I booked an appointment online for my daughter who was 3.  Prior to booking I stopped by to get a recommendation on which stylist would be the best one to do my daughter's hair and was told that Tricia was the stylist.  I followed her on Instagram to see her work and was pleased and booked an appointment online.  The booking option did not offer the ability to choose a kids braided style .. so I chose the only kid option available as I wanted to ensure they know the appointment is for a child and I also left notes in the note section specifying this info along with the braided style I was requesting.  Fast forward to appointment day, we arrived on time, the stylist was running late, and when she came out to see us, she asked if my daughter was getting her hair cut and styled.  I told her no, explained what I wanted done to her hair and also stated I had placed this info in the notes field upon booking.  She then looked at me, went to the front desk and told the employee there was a problem, and that she thought I had requested something different and that she would not be able to do my daughter's hair.  They both looked at me and told me that the booking apparatus stated that the appointment was not for braiding.  I explained that I specified exactly what I wanted done in the notes section as there was no option to choose a children's braiding appointment.  Upon looking further into the apparatus and notes they found the information I had specified.  I booked this appointment over a week ago, the appointment pends before it's accepted.. so basically no one bothered to review the notes section even though it allows you the option to place any notes you may have.  I was then told they were calling another stylist to assist.  This was exceptionally frustrating as I had taken the time to investigate the stylist I originally booked my appointment with and knew nothing about the woman (Marie) they had called, her qualifications or whether she worked with children as young as 3.  When she arrived, she started asking me questions and I didn't know who she was at first as no one bothered to introduce her.  By this time it was 4:45 or so and my 3 year is being a 3 year old.  I asked her if she was Marie and if she had any pictures to show of her work, as well as if she does hair for children as young as mine.. questions I asked before she arrived, which was answered with a yes but no one had any proof of her work.  Finally another employee got involved in our conversation and he was able to show me pics of his daughter's hair that she had done.  While it looked nice enough, his child was much older.. and working with a 3 year old requires patience and quick hands as they can't sit that long.  Unfortunately I had no other option at the time as we had an event to go to the next day so I took a chance.  The male employee was apologetic and we went and got my daughter's hair done.  I appreciate Marie for assisting, and she did a good job, but overall, the way the situation was handled could've been better.  To add insult to injury, one would've imagined some discount of some sort would've been offered for the trouble, either at the time or for a future appointment.. nope that didn't happen.  I got charged the full price AND a fee for using my debit card.. of course there was no sign anywhere to state that there was a fee for using a card.  This maybe a known fact to some but I am a new customer.  So I paid, and marched my child out the door.. with no intentions of ever coming back.  Sad..if it was handled better.. they would've had a repeat customer..as it's only 10 minutes away .. man do I miss our old salon in MD.",2019-10-04 23:40:31

We ordered our food mind you they have advertised they open at 12, we got there around 1pm. He claimed he has two types of rice but only one right now. They do not serve beef patties either.
We order our food, it does take about 25-30 mins to get it.

We were fine with no waitress or air condition we just wanted to eat before heading back to work.

I called the salon on 3/16/18 and spoke to Sparkle; I was able to come in later that afternoon for a consultation.  The consultation went well.  I had shoulder length hair, although my hair is very soft and thin.  I was looking for a minor cut and color to give my hair some style, shape, and sass.  I shared all of this with Sparkle and showed her several pictures of the cut I desired; some of the pictures were even from the photo gallery on her salon's website.  After the consultation, I scheduled an appointment for 3/20/18.  With that said, when I came in for my appointment, I was confident that Sparkle and I were on the same page regarding what I wanted to have done.  We even discussed color and I showed her the same pictures again as a refresher.  Unfortunately, and to my determent, the consultation was the end of my positive experience with Absolutely Fabulous Hair Salon.  

When I left the salon after my appointment and got in my car, I just cried and cried.  Sparkle chopped off all of my hair; I was just shy of a big chop.  There are 3 different cuts in my hair. The the top of my hair is one length.  Each side of my hair is a different length, to the point that I had side burns on one side of my hair and not the other.  Furthermore, we had discussed a particular shade of red for the color during the consultation.  However, my hair is now two different colors; the top is some shade of red and the sides of my hair are a brick color. Finally, once I got home and continued to assess the damage, I discovered severe breakage in the center of my hair. 

Needless to say, I was mortified!  To add insult to injury, Sparkle charged me $150 for this sloppy, botched job.  I felt so unattractive, I looked like a boy. She destroyed my hair!  All I can do now is wait for it to grow out and live in baseball caps.  There are not enough words to say how disgusted I was by this whole experience.  However, I didn't say anything to Sparkle after my appointment because all I wanted to do was sprint out of that salon, get home, and hide.  I just didn't know what to do with myself or even how to fix it at the time. 

To my surprise, I received an email from Sparkle on 3/22/18; although, the email came from a different person's name (Ione Thomas) but thankfully I read it anyway.  I took the opportunity to finally voice how extremely dissatisfied I was with my hair.  To date, Sparkle has not responded back to my email.  Not even so much as to apologize for her terrible work. I guess customer service is nonexistent!  Of course, I will never patronize this salon again.

Reply to owner response:  Sparkle you're a liar!  There was never an offer to correct any of the issues for free.  I absolutely did not love anything about my look.  I don't know where you got that impression from. You flat out ruined my hair!  The cut and color of my hair is an abomination.  Your license should be revoked for the damage you did to my hair.

As far as the rest of the place it was not clean either and I almost fell walking up to the single register that was not self service when I slipped on the super GREASY floor.

I stood at the register with my 2 hot coffees, some snacks, and an ice coffee while the cashier was having a conversation with another employee.  They both saw me but just continued to ignore me and converse with each other.  I let it go for 2 minutes then spoke up and asked if they could ring up my purchase.

On my way out I felt my shoes sliding on the greasy floor.  I assume it's from the fries and fried chicken sitting in the steam tables next to the registers.

I left disappointed after having high hopes to try this place out.

I went for a girls day on a Saturday afternoon there was maybe 5 customers but the bartender would not allow us to push 2 tables together to keep my party together. We were told it would be in the way even tho there was not one customer and we were in a corner not in the middle of any walk way. Meanwhile across the other side there was a party that had tables pushed together with no problem. The drinks were overpriced with very little to no alcohol so expect to pay $15 for a cup of juice. Please educate your staff on what is on your menu when ordering a Latin appetizer the bartender was clueless asking what is that it was clearly on the menu or I wouldn't have asked for it. The food was terrible it took over an hour to get our food which were all appetizers and she forgot one of our items.

Villa Deli is located in Sicklerville, NJ right across the street from the Winslow Diner. Full disclosure my family moved to Sicklerville in 2005 and I legit only discovered the deli...yes it's that good that we simply call it ""the deli""....like 5 years ago. That's wild considering that I passed it hundreds of time and had no idea what I was missing out on, but lets just say I made up for lost time since then. I've pretty much tried everything on the menu and haven't had anything bad yet. Everything is on point and when I say everything I mean EVERYTHING. Cheesesteak? Banging. Cheeseburgers? Elite. Cold hoagies? Yes lawd. Fries and sides, chicken cutlet, fried chicken, chicken salad, wraps, breakfast sandwiches, huge fresh salads, crab cakes, mac and cheese, paninis, motherfucking bacon wrapped filet's??? All. So. Damn. Good.

And boy they don't skimp, whatever you get from Villa Deli know that the portions are going to be on point. Every single day of the week they have some sort of special going on, one of my favorites are their homemade tacos on Monday and Tuesday. I'm basically here once a week just for these a lone and for less than 2 bucks a piece who can blame me. I put Chino onto the deli and the taco special when him and his boo bought their house in Sicklerville and I think he said he put down 10 tacos on his first visit because they were so legit.

The Deli's true bright spot in my hungry humble opinion though is the hot box. Every single night they load this bad boy up with different delicious items. The only way to know ahead of time what's going on for that day is to call ahead of time or just pop in. I choose to pop in because sometimes you have to let your eyes and nose pick your meal. Maybe that's why it's always packed because people are doing the same thing, freaking copy cats I tell ya. One day they might have stuffed salmon, and another it could be chicken cordon bleu and everything in between.

If you choose to do the hot box you get your main dish and two sides and as I mentioned above they don't skimp, their going to load that platter the hell up. Me and Wayne have developed a bat signal when the hot box is especially poppin, we'll text each other ""Yoooo the hot box is showing OUT today!"". As soon as that text is received we're both instantly en route like bugs bunny following a delicious scent. Oh and I forgot to mention not only is this platter basically two 5 star restaurant quality meals, it's only like 12 bucks. You.Can't.Beat.That. I usually end these reviews by saying ""So if you're in the area, check out (insert name)"" but nah even if you're outside the area you should check out this deli because it's that damn good!

dWmuHzFE_NPigtGZgAodqQ,0RX9w878R80Ok5iPrNBv3g,ASli9FU9tdpvUQKgQ5zNIA,5,8,2,2,"I actually found out about Sicklerville Soul while I was scrolling Instagram one day and after checking out a few pics and wiping drool from my mouth I finally said enough is enough and went to check them out. Everything was so amazing the first time through, that for about a month I went basically once a week, don't judge me. My first time through I got the fried fish hoagie (Lettuce, tomato, onion, & cheese) which they dubbed the best in town on Instagram, and the fried chicken & shrimp combination meal with mac and cheese and rice. Before I had SS my favorite fish hoagie came from Baltimore Seafood which was also located in Sicklerville but they shut down shop and honestly I think they moved back to Baltimore. So I've been looking to fill the void for about 3 years now and yea...void filled.

For the most part when you hear the ""Best in town"" quotes from an establishment their just trying to get people in the door, well I can honestly say this was the best fish hoagie I've ever had. The fish itself was seasoned and fried perfectly and the roll was lowkey the secret star of the show. It was soft, yet firm and was so delicious I almost went back to just cop a bag of whatever brand rolls they were using. They also use a secret sauce that set the whole thing off, it's truly a mouthwatering delicious sandwich.

Now on to the fried shrimp and chicken platter. Listen this is when I knew this spot was going to be regular in my rotation, you're not always in the mood for a fish hoagie..but my fat ass can almost always eat some scrimps and chicken wings. They split the shrimp, season them with their secret blend, and fry them to golden perfection. So.Fucking.Good. The wings were fried using the same blend and the combination of these two with the fish hoagie and the flavorful mac and cheese almost had your boy shed a few tears of joy.

Nah all jokes aside I've since had the grilled salmon dinner with broccoli and yellow rice, the buffalo shrimp with fries, breakfast and more. Every single thing I've gotten from SS has been perfect and you can tell they take pride in making every item with love. Whenever I'm craving soul food and I'm anywhere in that area, SS is the number one place I'm stopping at.",2018-06-13 16:12:50
rzaCc2cmNlgkrQeD4EUCUg,pzikC7tVCIcGSX9XkyKmDw,vFFDwoLEBflSyPpIQq_KyA,1,10,5,1,"I grew up in this area. This is an outdoor makeshift ""hut"" lavishly decorated from the dollar store built with 2x4's and plywood from Home Depot. It sits in a former old vacant dilapidated parking lot - which they have failed to pave I might add. It attracts more for those of the whiter shades - biker gangs and local trash. 

Before I go on, I must qualify my next statements. I am of mixed race and rest assured I have friends and family of all races. Yet I KNOW when ""my money is no good here."" Matter of fact, I can say the food is no good here either. IMO this place is NOT African American friendly nor do I recommend anyone who respects how other  racial groups are treated stop here either. 

You with your black, brown, or tan skin do not bother and those who live in the predominantly black neighboring communities already know! That is I suppose unless you like feeling awkward and supremely out of place. This is mainly for you Yelpers just passing through. 

In summation: Spend your money and time in a more worthy establishment - try Buffalo Wild Wings or one of the other good spots just down the road.

First of all, the atmosphere is pretty awesome. Very modern, very new. I wanted to stay lol.
There is a lot of glass to browse, but honestly it is more like art work; every piece is definitely unique and beautiful in its own way. 
Second of all, as a new client unfamiliar with anything in the store, I was greeted instantly, given a few minutes to look around, then was nicely assisted by the owner himself. He was so knowledgeable and helpful and aided my boyfriend and myself in getting the best things for us. And on top of that threw us a great deal.
The price for everything we purchased was fantastic; and I am most definitely planning on frequenting this amazing new shop:)
I felt as though my business was truly appreciated, and I was floored with kindness, which goes such a very long way.
I recommend checking this place out to anyone who is in need of a place to feel beyond welcomed, being helped in every sense of the word, and being beyond ecstatic to come back to your ""home shop"".

This seemingly efficiently-run salon is very large and busy, workers bustling around and too many people behind the front desk chatting. Stylists were walking around with black leggings and uggs. Too much of a casual environment for my liking, but still I stayed. Seeing such unfriendly employees behind the front desk should have told me to leave upon first sight, but I fought the urge.
I had an appointment and was asked to have a seat while I waited for my esthetician. About half an hour later, a woman came for me who I was not originally scheduled with. This would have been fine if I was made aware of the situation, my lady being held up with a client. However, I just sat there... and sat some more...  without being asked if I needed anything and without being told my practitioner was running late.
eventually, I was guided back to the waxing rooms. Thankfully this area is separate from the salon. It is a much more soothing environment with dim lights and no audible sound of blow dryers and chatty stylists. I was expecting a great wax...  
The new esthetician was nice and we made light conversation. However, her techniques left a lot to be desired. She did not wash her hands prior to the waxing. Albeit gloves wore worn, hand washing should be practiced when working near genitals regardless.
Another highly unsatisfactory point was the technique in which the hair was removed. 
One Popsicle stick was used throughout my session to apply wax. This is called  ""double-dipping."" Double dipping into the wax is taboo because it introduces bacteria into the pot. That puts my health and the health of others at risk for spreading bacteria and causing infection. A waxer should have brand-new sticks available for each swipe to the skin. My practitioner took none of the aforementioned steps (multiple sticks or hand washing) to ensure the least amount of germ spreading. She also failed to ask what medications, if any, I had been taking. She also did not test the wax temperature before applying it to my skin.
Brazilian waxing at Hello Gorgeous is $55, a slightly higher price than other salons within the region. For the price, I anticipated more sanitary practices, but unfortunately Hello Gorgeous fell short.

We barely ate any and the waitress saw that we didn't and offered to take them off the bill. My son and I both had wings and they were actually cooked great how ever the sauces were pretty gross and even though the wings were cooked great they too were swimming in grease.

It's when you start ordering specialty pizzas, sandwiches and more adventurous stuff that you need to watch out.  A good deal of their strombolis and calzones have American cheese in them (yes, American... in addition to like mozzarella and ricotta), and way too much of it.

It just goes to show that just because a place is renovated and new high tech options are added, it doesn't necessarily mean that the complete service improves. Long waits, half of the techs can't provide full service and as a result you are left waiting for half of your service. I know it is normal for nail techs to talk while providing services and along with that comes a running joke about how they are talking about clients but these ladies take it to the next level. They speak in their native language while looking at clients and snickering. I went in a week ago to have an acrylic replaced (because unlike many other places, my refills never last me two weeks after coming here) and the woman didn't use the UV gel after I had told her many times I had UV gel. I ended up paying $3, and leaving the salon with one nail that was CLEARLY different from the others. I would have gone elsewhere but I had an interview and was in a bind. The young girl I've had the last two times is terrible, I feel like she should be a student in nail tech school. There are two women there that have been there since I've been a customer but I rarely get them because everyone is aware they are the only ladies who are equipped to handle all aspects of their jobs.

We were nearby at the time, so I took a quick look at Yelp, saw they had four stars (and were a pub), so I agreed to go.

...Uuuum, yes. Somehow we both missed the whole ""Kilt Girl"" thing that this chain does. So basically, if you're considering a trip, please know that it's basically an Irish-sports-bar-themed Hooters with a 90% male clientele and 20-something rail-thin servers who casually display basically everything via their bra/short skirt uniform.

We stayed because the idea of deciding on another place for dinner while so hungry seemed taxing. Throughout the meal, my mom couldn't hear a thing I said because of the noise level. Like, it's absurdly loud in here.

The menu itself was pretty nice. I went with the stuffed chicken and my mom chose the BBQ pork mac and cheese. I had some plate envy. Her dish was great!

They have a large selection of [mostly domestic] beers on draft and a handful of bottles. Fortunately, they also were serving Forgotten Board's Funnel Cake. You'll have to ask to see if that's what's still available when you visit, because their menu says: ""Forgotten Boardwalk,"" whereas the other items actually specify what the beer is. (Our server didn't know it was an entire brewery -- she didn't like beer.)

Getting the check at the end of the meal turned out to be a bit of a struggle. Why? Because our Kilt Girl had sat down at the table next to us and was holding a long conversation with some lone dude. At the bar, another Kilt Girl was sitting with a guy. I'm willing to assume that's part of their job, but maybe another Kilt Girl could pick up the pace and check on the other Kilt Girl's table that's obviously ready to wrap up food and head out.

So, basically, this is personally not a restaurant I'll ever visit again based on the atmosphere. But if you're into that type of thing, it'll be a local haven for you.",2015-10-26 14:17:26

These reviews are solely about the restroom experience I've had and I will try to leave the food/service to a minimum. The kilt has never been my favorite or even close to favorite place to drink as the service is usually slow and the prices high. Food at the kilt is slightly above average for all that are wondering. Now to the meat and potatoes of the review.... the bathroom experience. Location location location. The bathroom is right by the bar which is a always a plus, as no one wants to walk a distance to drain the main vein. My initial reaction was that it's a little cramped in there but it's not a deal breaker. By far the biggest concern was the lack of urinals, for only one is located inside this establishment. 1 urinals and 2 stalls is not efficient enough to gain 5 stars. But I will say the biggest upside to this bathroom is the paper towels(no one likes hand dryers, which is an atautomatic 2 star deduction), and the lighting. I look goooooood in that lighting. A certified G. So the negatives are the lack of places to pee if it gets crowded and the positives are the location,lighting and paper towls(god bless them). 4/5 stars.

She actually encouraged us to tell the manager in hopes something would finally be done.  Spoke with Mike Smalls ""manager"" who said ""he"" whomever ""he"" is was getting plumbing quotes.

One thing that really impressed me was the fact that I originally had an appointment for more that just one service.

She said I would end up with new growth very quickly in the areas that were too short for the wax to grab and I should wait to have a better experience and outcome.

I may sound trivial to the casual reader, but any real eater worth his waist will tell you that a good local pizza joint is more important than the public school system. It took me a good week to build up the courage.....but I'm glad I did. I was relieved to find that I could get a decent slice in the neighborhood. I'm a fan of their pizza, calzones, and turnovers. Someone odd that I noticed is that the slice pizza (as in you just show up and order a slice) is a thinner crust pizza. Where as if you order a pie it comes thicker. Their delivery is quick and they haven't screwed up my order (which is a huge plus) 
A couple slight complaints is every time I call to pick up they tell me 10 mins....it's never 10 mins usually closer to 20. I'm not a big fan of the rest of the ""non pizza"" food on the menu....especially the meatballs.

This was my first time at this Tilted Kilt location, I've been to other locations and they were great.  The waitresses were always super friendly and attentive at every location I've been to in the past.  Today, although my waitress was polite and gorgeous (looked amazing in the Tilted Kilt outfit), she was lacking the main ingredient which is friendliness and being talkative.  It's not like she was busy, the place was empty.  She was walking around doing nothing the whole time and completely ignored me.  She even completely disappeared from the restaurant a few times.  Look, with all due respect, if you don't like your job get another one.  Being a waitress in general (but ESPECIALLY at a Hooters or Tilted Kilt) require you to be extra friendly even when you aren't in the mood to be.  I understand some girls might feel awkward walking around in sexy outfits but hey that's what you signed up for, if you don't like it give the job to someone more confident who doesn't mind showing her body, maybe try a Ruby Tuesday's or TGIF instead.  I still gave her a 30% tip which was double what she deserved, but had she been nicer it would have been much more. Maybe she was having a bad day, but I also work in the food business and customer service is EVERYTHING, I'm not looking for a date or someone to take home lol, but at least PRETEND you wanna shoot the breeze with me a little especially since you had NOTHING else to do.  I understand if she had a few tables to attend to and the place was actually busy, but during most of my stay I was her only customer lol. Besides, more talking equals more tips, and tips are what being a waitress is about lets be honest. Onto the good.  The restaurant is beautiful, very nicely done.  Has a cozy feel to it, high ceilings, designed to fit the theme very well.  The food I got was great, burger was tasty and big, and cooked just how I asked for.  Fries weren't overcooked but perfectly crispy and hot.  The prices are very reasonable too.  I hope this was ""beginners bad luck"" this time, maybe just a one time hiccup.

After a few min she came back in and went over some more details, gave me instructions on where to put my belongs and left the room.

The massage she performed wasn't the worst I've had but it also wasn't even close to the best. During the massage I was scratched a few times by her long acrylic nails and she skipped some areas she had done on the opposing side of my body. I assume the timer expired because abruptly she ended the session at 12:26. This wasn't even close to an actual hour massage.

That being said, I still prefer the many Hooters locations in NJ...for one reason only.  The girls here, although looking beautiful, have no personalities and are very awkward acting.  They won't engage you at all and at times completely ignore you for like a half hour straight.  Hooters on the other hand, trains their staff a lot better it seems.  The girls at Hooters are genuinely friendly, talkative, and very attentive..and that's what makes the difference, customer service.

But only Hooters will get 5 stars from me, I guess there's a reason every single Tilted Kilt location has closed down in the past year and a half.  If ""the Kilt"" can turn up their customer service and make me a believer I'll give it 5 stars, till then the best I can give is 3 and that's a gift.",2019-08-23 01:06:07

They tapped into the old Hooters vive.  With a British Isles twist that is just brilliant.  Sitting at the bar looking around it was hard for me to pick out stuff they arnt doing perfectly.  This place is very cool, I will definitely come here often.  The decor is great (one exception for some reason they hung the Union Jack flag from the ceiling, as Irish Catholic I do take offense to that!) The uniforms the girls where are great.  But besides the look they are very friendly and unapproachable.  The music is good and at a reasonable volume,  you can hear it but your conversations don't get drowned out.  

As for the food I had the Irish nachos which were great however a little overpriced.  And the wings which I would rate as a seven.  I do consider myself very critical about buffalo wings.  For those of you who have lived in South Jersey for a while there are places like the original pic-a-lilli's on 206 or the former Pine wood Lodge on the Black Horse Pike that are hands down great wings that I would give it 10 too.  Then there are places like Buffalo Wild Wings that are best a 2 out of 10.   As far as the wings at the Tilted Kilt.  The sauce was good, but they only serve half wings and called them full wings. ( any place that does this is automatically an 8 or below in my book) the order was a little bit on the light side although they do give you french fries with your order.  The wings are also little overpriced in my opinion.

Inclusion though, the small imperfections in the food,  do not take away from the overall experience and I still say this place is a hands down  five star.",2015-11-16 19:28:26

My service was more like 2 I came in for a Brazilian Wax. I arrived 15 mins early.. when I booked my appointment online my confirmation my waxer name was Gianna. So as I'm waiting a waxer comes out look as though she was about to go on break but the receptionist asked her to take me the vibe that I got was that she rather had went on break then took me so she takes me back tells me to strip down from the bottoms only and tells me to hope on the bed.... for some reason this wax was more painful then any other wax I have ever had.. she was got done literally felt like 15 mins usually my wax takes at least 30-40 mins so I'm thinking okay she must be good at what she does. I hop off the table and proceed to pay.. I still felt wax stuck to my skin and in my back area.. and come to find out the waxer that was on my confirmation email name Gianna was not the person who waxed me. So I leave and go home finally take a look in the mirror and she missed lots of places were hair could have been waxed off.. she missed a big section in my back area.. i was very disappointed.. I called the wax center and stated my issue and they stated that I could come in the next day for a touch up.. which is an inconvenience to me .. I felt like she rushed it and didn't take her time to check if all the hair that was able to be removed was actually removed. I was go back today and hopefully it is done right I will NOT be booking another appointment with them. I had a way better experience at Coco Miyagi I stop going because it was getting expensive but I think I may have to go back. Also Naked Peach also had better service and actually took there time with you. I do not recommend this place for anyone.,2017-10-07 11:43:49

The waitresses are wearing these awful Halloween costumes that leave really little to the imagination and the food's not really any good. I ordered shepherd's pie, which I love. The menu advertised a crust of rosemary Parmesan mashed potatoes. Potatoes came out with a coating of yellow cheese, and a quick dip into the meat revealed a pool of grease in the skillet. Ate it anyway. I don't throw away food unless it's absolutely revolting. 

Tipped the server $7 for her trouble. Couldn't look at her though. For some reason the getup made me uncomfortable.

I ended up with the oxtail which was f****ing great omfg lol this has to be the best I've had. The savory broth had so much flavor. It reminded me of the food in lil Haiti in Miami!

I happened upon this place on yelp, but of course, have had so many wins this way :-)  We were doing a job in the area and this came up with a menu that could accommodate my current diet restrictions.

I asked if it would be ok to pay for the full hour but only get a 40 min massage (no problem paying in full btw). They tell me no, I will have to wait for tomorrow or later for another appointment. Keep in mind again I offered to pay the full hour. They said that the 40 min would not be good enough as my appointment is an emergency for neck and back strain. I have had this similar injury before and had the problem fixed in as little as 15 min, so I know 40 min was plenty. They insisted they couldn't do it and I had to wait til 5pm tomorrow.

I came ontime/ early for my appointment for a full bikini wax. This was not my first time to get waxed but my first time at the sicklerville location. Store was nice like the brand. I made my appointment on the phone the day before I believe or earlier in the week. I just chose the luck of the draw for waxers since I saw only 2 reviews of the location and it was my first time to that location. I waited almost a half hour extra before my appointment which the staff made me well aware that she was behind once I already arrived which was fine for me. No issue. Bathrooms were all out of order, oh well still not bothered by that. Danielle was very nice. Yes waxes hurt I had one a few weeks before as well and it was a little painful but tolerable. But this appointment when she just was placing the wax on my hair she was running it back and forth and yanking the hairs back and forth while almost cool ( sorry for the graphic detail) not pulling the strips off fast, almost sometimes yanking instead of pulling quckly. I understand sometimes people have off days or stuff like that so maybe that's to blame , I'm just not really thrilled the off day might have been the day I decided to get waxed lol. There didn't seem to be a method to where she went next like the past waxes I've had. I'm not an expert but I belive it should be applied in one direction then pulled in the opposite . I felt like she was frosting a cake.  Hair was still left on when I got home. I was just so overwhelmed by the whole process that I didn't even want to write this review or call and go back in for a touch up. I hope people will take this review constructively and know that I am trying to be fair.

Unfortunately, within two-three days of receiving my wax I had a full blown UTI. I did not know what caused it, until I told my doctor of my recent wax. Apparently staph infections are a common infection from waxing centers. I did not have time to get a culture to prove it was a staph, but I was treated with antibiotics specifically for staph and it went away. I did not know staph infections were common with bikini/ Brazilians prior to this. It is sad this would happen from such a reputable company. This was not my first Brazilian, and I can say my experience was less than satisfying. When I had called, I asked for someone who was experienced, but I don't think that is what I got. The woman who did the wax had good bedside manner, but was a little sloppy. I appreciate her getting close, but I believe the wax went to close to where it should not have.

The food/drink/atmosphere was virtually the same on both visits. It's a typical sports bar, lots of tvs so visibility is good for the games. Beer selection is good and reasonably priced, food was actually really good. 

What kept this place from a 5 start review was the service. First time, we had a great waitress named Natalie. Bright, energetic, friendly, prompt. Really made us feel appreciated, which is how girls in these places rely on making their money (even though our group was one male and two female friends). Loved her, and asked to be seated with her on our second visit (same group of friends) but she wasn't working. Instead we got Francesca...

Now this girl was very pretty and probably gets plenty of good business from her male customers that are appreciative of this. But when she saw that two of our party were women. ..it was like she just checked out. Like she figured she wouldn't be able to woo us with her looks and skimpy outfit to get better tips and decided not to try. She sat down with the guys at the table next to us for a chat several times, while virtually ignoring us all night. And we were there for a few hours of UFC fights, eating and drinking the whole time, it's not like our bill was small. When the fights ended and people started to leave, she DISAPPEARED. I'm talking the entire section of tables was vacated for a good 15 or 20 minutes, while we hadn't seen her for our check at all. We weren't still eating or drinking, it was obvious we were ready to go; she'd taken care of all her other tables and then vanished. I've never been so close to skipping out on a check in my life. I'm getting out of my chair to leave when Francesca shows back up, looking bored and unapologetic, and says ""oh sorry I was helping other tables"". WHAT other tables, she'd cleared them out ages ago ands left us! I called her out on it kind of passively, and she didn't even seem to care. 

So yea, if you find a girl you like here, try to stick with her, or just sit at the bar where you can't get forgotten. Maybe if I was a guy I'd have had a different experience here, but female-bodied guests be prepared to get ignored.

*** so I just checked out all the other reviews and wasn't entirely surprised to see that while most men had had a great experience here, most women that visited and reviewed had experiences like mine.

That is about all they have that is good. I've been here twice and sat at the bar both times. The first time, the female bartender was pretty good. Quick service, but the second time, this guy was terrible. The place was not busy at all and he was running around making prep work the priority. 
Now, onto the food. Their boneless wings are terrible. Always over cooked and taste like they have been sitting under a heat light for hours. So far, I've tried 8 different sauces, each one worse than the one before. For a place that is supposed to be known for their wings, this is a disgrace.

Had high hopes on a great chain wings place and unfortunately it did not live up to expectations. The wings were small, more mushy than crispy.  Think they did not have the oil hot enough.  The Garlic Parm sauce was good as well as the Korean sauce.  Again, the wings lacked freshness and were not of the quality of a wing chain and also not a great value for $12.  For that price the wings should have been a bit beefier and better cooked.

We also tried the pretzel burger and there was no question it was frozen.  Prepared well, but not a great taste.

As for cocktails, alcohol very under poured for the price.

Walked in to 3 hostesses, one talking to a young kid, one staring at the wait list and one with her back to us talking to the wait list girl. Took a good 2 minutes before the one with her back to us turned around and I had to blurt out, ""2 please!?"". She said ok and turned back around. The girl staring at the paper looked up and asked how many...really?

After that service was good our waiter Jim was the best part of the experience. I ordered the Mediterranean salad which came out nicely presented but didnt include the hummus and pita as stated on the menu. The food runner dropped the food and ran off before I could even ask for silverware. So I waited a good while, the hubby was halfway done his nachos before Jim returned and I could ask about the missing items. He then returned with flatware and hummus, no pita. I had to ask again for it and I felt kind of rude but come on the Expo or food runner should at least know what comes with each dish and it shouldn't leave the kitchen until then. Jim also shouldnt have brought the hummus without the pita but hes a teenager like most of the staff so ill let it slide. Also, the hubby said "" no im good"" after being asked for a third beer. 2 mins later Jim brought back a beer. Huh? We didn't make an issue of it and he drank it.

Hubby ordered naked tenders next. Came out with sauce on the side but no celery or blue cheese. For chicken tenders? I thought that was common sense . Chicken wings get it but not tenders? 

The bar area is filled with tables and stools with no backs. Haven't sat on a stool with no back rest in years and after 15 mins my back was on fire (im 30 mind you). For all the money they invest, get some decent stools your guests can enjoy. The bar top and outside seating has backs, why not the high tops?

Atmosphere: 
The Winslow Family Diner is massive, and I was not expecting that!  There isn't a lot online about the diner, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  The outside is large and modern, and the inside has a ""diner feel"" with plenty of booths, tables, and bakery case in the front.  It was quiet when we arrived.

Coffee: 
The coffee was good.  It was hot and fresh, and the waitress asked if we wanted refills plenty of times.  I have no complaints.

Food: 
The Winslow Restaurant has everything you want or need in a diner.  There are plenty of options from breakfast, to lunch, and dinner.  Despite the menu not being online, believe me you'll find everything you want in a diner.  With all of the choices, I wasn't really sure what sounded good.  Lisa mentioned a Greek salad, and I hadn't had one in a while, so I thought, why not!

When the salads came out, they were massive.  They were definitely two of the biggest diner salads I've seen in a while.  I wasn't complaining though.  There were plenty of toppings including anchovies, two types of olives, onions, more cheese than I knew what to do with, and a green lettuce base.   In all, it was one of the best diner salads I've had!

Service: 
The waitress was kind, refilled our drinks often, and our food came out quickly.  It's hard to complain about that!

Overall Thoughts/Summary:
I liked the Winslow Family Restaurant, and it's one of my favorite in the area.  I will definitely be back.",2018-05-13 20:46:28

We wanted to grab a quick bite and while there were other chain restaurant choices available here, we liked the look of this place and we had not eaten Chinese buffet in quite some time.

At 7.99 a person for lunch, and 1.49 for large soft drinks with free refiils, the price can't be beat. The lunch buffet was rather small, but still had some nice choices. I opted for my standard General Tso's chicken, along with sweet and sour chicken, lo mein noodles, and a generous helping of cold u-peel it shrimp. My wife had some of their sushi rolls and said they were good. She also tried their spare ribs and a few other things that I missed liked dumplings and fried zucchini. Light breading and light grease when it came to the fried food selections, not nearly as bad as other buffets.

They also had a hibachi grill where you could pick what you wanted grilled to order but we really did not feel like waiting so we went with what was already prepared.

There is not much of a salad bar here, but it's an Asian buffet, and I do not expect a decent salad bar. I only know of one other Asian buffet in the area that has a salad bar that is worthwhile. The rest, much like this one, have a few shreds of lettuce and a few chopped up veggies. No biggie.

There was assorted fruit however, such as bananas in strawberry sauce, crushed pineapple, fresh cantaloupe and fresh watermelon. Some cookies and cakes for dessert as well. I opted for an ice cream cone from the soft serve machine.

Service was fast and friendly, drinks were refilled as needed and plates were taken away promptly. The place was very clean and light cheerful sounding Asian music played in the background.

What struck me as odd about this place were the decorations on the walls. Looked like they were bought from a Bennigans going out of business sale. Elvis, Michael Jackson, Scarface, The Beatles, and John Wayne montages adorned the walls. Stood out like a sore thumb if you asked me, but it still did not detract from a superb lunch.

Every time I try to go there is a line of cars wrapped around the building.  And NOT because they are spectacular or anything different than a typical McDonalds food wise.  It's because this has to be the SLOWEST McDonalds i've ever seen in my entire life.   

I've gone a few times the rare times where there wasn't a line wrapped around the building, and I watch the few cars in front of me.  10-15 minutes to get their food and it's a SMALL bag of food!  I've seen this several times, and personally experienced it myself as well with small orders taking them like 10-15 minutes to hand me my small order (somehow it takes them 15 minutes to make and bag a cheeseburger and medium fries even though the inside isn't crowded).  How in the heck are people waiting 10-15 minutes at the food window to get small orders? What are you doing in there? It's not even like the inside was crowded those times either.  You know that line of cars I mentioned forming because of their slow drive thru service?  The few times I went when it wasn't like that, by the time I got through the drive thru it WAS like that.  I'm like ""oh no wonder the line is always so long, when I got here there was no line, i've been waiting so long to get through the drive thru that a huge line formed behind me (and the few cars in front of me).  

Seriously, fast food shouldn't take THAT long.  It shouldn't take 20 minutes to get each car through the drive thru!  If you are taking this long then there is SERIOUSLY something wrong in the kitchen.  

If you are in a hurry to get somewhere then do NOT go to this location, choose a different McDonalds location.  Trust me.  This one is unbelievably slow.

The atmosphere is phenomenal. As you walk into this quaint sushi bar that has a modern twist on the old time classic food, the word that comes to mind is sushi. The flawless white furniture mixed with the classy decor and soft changing lights in the background will put you at ease after a long tiring day. The friendly staff will take care of you the entire time with anything you need, from picking the perfect meal, to making sure your glass is never empty.

Cheap prices. Great specials. Great soup. Great breakfast & sandwiches.

Many seating options (booths/traditional diner or a more formal dining room with tables)

Ordered several rolls that were all delicious. Favorite roll was the mango roll. Not a fan of sashimi but my buddy said it was decent. He did leave behind a couple of them because he didn't like the texture. Not sure how rare that so I won't. 

I also ordered a tom yum soup which was great. Not overly salted and the chicken was very tender. The only thing is the portion was tiny and barely any veggies and chicken in the soup. What I did get was cooked well. The lemongrass wasn't too over powering.

The decor and vibe of the place was very modern, clean, almost hipster esque. I enjoyed it. An unexpected style in the area. Refreshing and will be my new sushi spot. Prices were average and did not make a killing, although some of the apps were a bit more than I would expect for the portion.

Our lunches came with soup and salad.  My salad was very good - love the ginger dressing!  Vince's miso was very good as well.

We ordered two sushi rolls - spicy tuna and shrimp tempura.  The plating was beautiful and made the tasty sushi that much more delicious I think!  

I ordered the chicken Yaki Udon (see pix!), which was really really good - absolutely tender chicken with perfectly cooked noodles.  The smell of the dish was pleasing as the stir fry smell sometimes makes the food less appealing to me.  

Vince had a Bento box, which looked very nice and he enjoyed it alot as well.  He opted for the curry chicken dish and it came along with a salad and white rice.  (see his review for full details!)

I wanted to order a salad but there were hardly enough carrots for one and there were hardly any options for anything else. No croutons, asked if there were chips, the girl said no then I noticed a huge tub of them behind her and decided she wasn't playing with a full deck so a smoothie would be safer. Meanwhile the other girl was making my boyfriends wrap as a salad, he corrected her that it was a wrap. Then she started to make it using the wrong lettuce, we didn't say anything til she started to add chicken to the only vegetarian option they had, he's vegetarian. He opted for a smoothie too, too bad the straws were too small and it was full of ice so he could hardly drink it.

I'm talking waiters that straight up tell you the onion rings are frozen, waitresses that don't even take your drink order for 20 minutes even while walking back and forth past your table, bar tenders that go on break in the middle of your meal and leave you sitting at the bar with no service whatsoever. I'm talking about managers that address your complaint that you ordered your beer over 15 minutes ago, and your beer STILL takes another 10 minutes to come out (when you're sitting within spitting distance of the actual beer taps and could pour the damned thing yourself). This is the only place I've ever been to that will cut you off after 4 drinks and say it's ""policy"". The place is usually packed with disinterested staff that don't seem to be doing anything, including waiting on the customers. For a ""sports bar"" the place is always crawling with children and families, unless you sit in the bar area.

The food is nothing special. I only ever get boneless wings there, which aren't bad, and the large variety of sauces is fun. The selection of beer is boring and overpriced. I would encourage everybody to just order out rather than eat in the establishment...

...BUT! If you do order out, check to make sure that your order is correct before you get in the car and drive home, and leave them plenty of time to make your food if you need it by a particular time. I ordered a party platter of boneless wings for a super bowl party. I ordered at 1pm and was told the wings would be ready at 5:30. Now I understand super bowl sunday is a big day for a wing place and I expected it to be busy. But the place was a train wreck. Disorganized, chaotic, and full of unhappy-looking customers and staff. They had a few tables pushed together and covered with dozens of orders waiting for pick up. But... not mine. MINE was lost and delayed by 30 minutes, along with at least 3 other customers I saw there. And the icing on the cake was that when I got home, I found that they had given me the wrong wings.

Bottom line: you need to have the patience of a saint and very low expectations if you choose to eat here. If you meet those criteria, try to enjoy yourself. Try the Asian zing wings.",2015-07-03 02:10:56

We came toward opening and the restaurant was adequately staffed.  The service was wonderful and the waitress was extremely attentive.  However, the wings were horrible!  We tried 6 different types of sauces and rubs varying from sweet to very hot, but they all lacked flavor.

The wings themselves were not very juicy, lacked tender meat, and were generally over cooked.  If your name has ""wings"" in it, you had better figure out how to make some decent wings!

No, it angers me because of their prices.  Now, you might be wondering what I mean.  Well let me explain.  Their prices are horrendously expensive when compared to other Burger King locations within a 10 mile radius of this location.  Let me go into further detail so that you can understand why I say this.  Tonight, prior to writing this review, I decided to do a little research to see if this is still the case (I hadn't been visiting this location in a long time due to the huge price differences).  The results of my research were as follows:

Menu item:  Angry Whopper (SANDWICH ONLY)

Location: Blackwood Clementon Road; Price: $5.19
Location: 594 Cross Keys Road; Price: $7.19 

Are you *angry words* serious!?  A $2.00 difference?  That's absolutely ludicrous.  And it's not unique to this sandwich either.  ALL their items share a similar pricing issue.  Why is this locations so outrageously expensive compared to all other Burger King locations within a 10 mile radius?  

The -only- items that share similar pricing are the universally set promo items that are highly advertised at a set price on TV commercials (for example, the 2 for $5 deal).  The rest of the items are priced insanely higher than all other BK locations, for absolutely no reason.  Whoever owns this location really needs to stop gouging prices and price to stay competitive with other Burger King locations in the area.

This location is right down the street from my house, like 1 minute away, and I drive like 8 minutes to the Blackwood Clementon Road location just because the pricing is MUCH more realistic and fair.  If you want my business, then lower your prices.  You LOSE business when you are SIGNIFICANTLY (as my above example illustrated) more expensive than other BK locations people can choose to go to by only driving a little further.

Their staff is VERY friendly though.  So that's a plus, but not enough for an extra star.  Also their food is typically decent for fast food, so there's that, but it's not any better or worse than other BK locations.  It's typical of all BK food.

Please don't give this location business if you value paying a fair price for your food.  There is no reason that this location should be so much more expensive than other BK locations in the area.  Go to one of the other nearby locations, and save a decent chunk of your hard earned money.",2016-06-11 01:51:44

That is partly my fault, I had to order the lunch bento box. Overall it was good, but maybe my choice of red curry chicken was a stretch. The chicken and fresh veggies were perfectly cooked, but the curry was thin. Tricia selected chicken udon noodles, nicely done version of this staple. And we shared a 2 roll lunch special, shrimp tempura and spicy tuna. These were perfectly constructed and artfully plated. I appreciated the attention to detail that the chef employed by adding a bit of white and black sesame seeds to the rice.

I really liked the decor too. Hip and modern would be a good way to describe this tiny shop. With a long bar where patrons can engage with the very friendly chef. Our server was excellent too.

The decision to go here was mine since I really wanted them again...never again.

Its a great sports bar I'm sure it gets packed during football season since there are TV's galore but that's where the good stops.  Maybe I'm not one for ordering margaritas out so I thought I would try one here, definitely not worth $9.00.

We ordered the loaded nachos and they were OK as long as you ate from the middle, it was like they just dumped all the items right in the middle and there wasn't a lot to begin with so we basically had nachos and salsa for half of it 

My wings finally came out and a table of 15 came in and was seated in our area so from then on we were pretty much ignored the rest of the time.  We had to flag her down twice and knew it would be a while before getting what we needed.

Onto the wings...I'm not one for sending things back but when I took my first bite I was done.  I tried to send them back but after sitting there for another 20 minutes I just wanted the check so we could leave.  I think if she would have acknowledged the fact that when she asked if I wanted them wrapped and I said no they were horrible maybe I would feel like they care about customer satisfaction.

We also had the Appetizer sampler which is EXPENSIVE! IT was around $13 and didn't have a lot of food on it. The onion rings are pretty run of the mill battered type, nice and sweet, good, but not mind blowing. I had the potato wedges with queso also, expected something different, also, a good item, but not mind blowing.

There are lots of TVs, and I am pretty sure you can see the game you want to watch from any seat in there.

My wife and I got there around 1:30pm, were seated and it took 5 minutes for our waitress to show up when she did, we both ordered wings and two beers with limes.  The beers came first with no limes.  Wings came next.  The first two of mine were cold and the rest were hardly warm.  My wife's were all hardly warm, not hot at all.  When they were delivered my wife asked for 1 extra ranch and napkins.  5 min later a different waitress arrived with an extra ranch and an extra blue cheese although we didn't ask for it.  So we waited another 10 min for napkins and around that time another waitress, again not ours, showed up with 3 more blue cheeses for us although again none were ever asked for.  After this we had to get up and go ask the manager for napkins.  He got them for us.  After this my wife went to the restroom and yet another waitress that wasn't ours came up and said ""here's your extra blue cheese!"".  At this time we were finished with our food and had empty beers and a table full of wing bones and blue cheeses and were never ordered.  We then waited 20 min with nobody cleaning up or offering to refill beers or get our check.  We had to get the manager again and he had to take our card and run it for us.  I'm sorry that I don't remember names but it was from around 2-3pm.  Waitress was bar area w brown hair and Manager was a shorter guy.  We actually left Chickie and Petes and drove all the way to BDubs for good wings.  Bad Choice...

The only time we ever saw our waitress was when she returned with our limes she forgot.    

I am NOT ""that guy"" that complains all the time at all.  I understand things happen.  Maybe the girl had a bad day, but she could have at least told us what was going on instead of just leaving us at the table with empty beers and lots of blue cheeses for 20 min...",2012-08-24 19:30:55

The sushi is always fresh and delicious and are a highlight of their menu. Their hot meals are less spectacular, but are still pretty damn good, especially compared to similar meals in the area. Their fried rice is awesome. My ABSOLUTE FAVORITE menu item is their jalapeño popper. It isn't the traditional popper that is kept frozen at most pizza places; it's a popper with an elevated twist! It's a spicy pepper with cooked fish, deep fried and served with a hot sauce drizzle...Order it now!!!

Pros: 
Wings are tasty, they have fried pickles, there are something like 26 taps, and everyone seems pleasant. Outside seating available, and something like 100 TV screens. Nicely handicap accessible. Reasonable prices.

Cons:
Hottest wings sauce was eaten by a 14 year old girl without blinking her eyes. Noisy, only two urinals, most taps are domestic variations (bud, bud light) shots are small (maybe an ounce versus 1.5 or 2)

We checked in for the free edamame, and I'm glad it was free given the small portion with a $5 price tag. I ordered the rainbow roll and smoked salmon sashimi. The presentation on the plate was beautiful. I fell that the fish was a bit chewy and cold. I know that's an unusual description, but the ideal sushi I've had has a more appropriate temperature and when the fish isn't as cold, it isn't as tough and chewy. Nonetheless, it was suitable, but not for a price of $17 combined. 

My girlfriend ordered the Kani salad ($7) and Pad Thai Chicken ($12). I have to say, the Pad Thai Chicken looked greasy and bad and the taste matched the description. 

With the drinks, a first time visit cost $51 and we didn't finish the food. We waited quite a long time for the food. Not sure what the hype is about this place, but we weren't impressed.  In summary:

-over priced food
-small portions
-long wait time
-uncomfortable seating/noisy

Our server said they have 30 beers on tap which is awesome but Bud Light doesn't count as beer and I will never understand why so may people like IPA - unimpressed with the beer selection, they have everything you would expect and not much else.

We ordered the pretzel app which came out fast and was hot and tasty. I ordered medium traditional wings with mango habanero sauce, my friend ordered a burger with cheese curds on it. I noticed the menu doesn't list how many wings come with each portion, I suppose they do it by weight but why not just put a rough number on the menu? Our food was served quick, the wings were very spicy and better than what you would get at your local corner pizza joint, but not amazing. Side note: I do like their narrow cut fries.

Overall not bad. I paid a lot more than I expected for an app, a burger, and some wings. The wings themselves were not as good as my favorite wing spot, Miller's Ale House, but the service was prompt and friendly. I would only come here again if someone else was paying.

I also want to note: SPORTS. So many bold colors and TV's and sports paraphernalia everywhere, like I was getting hit in the face with sports. I mean I expected this to some extent, but I've not known other places like the old Champs and Miller's Ale House to be so sports themed.

Fries cold and Burger sloppily put together on a dirty bun. Thank God, I was close to home. I threw out their bun, toasted 2 pieces of toast, cut the ends off and gave myself a better presentation. I heated everything up for 30 seconds in the microwave.

It can be pretty loud and packed during big sports games for the area. There is an area of seating as soon as you walk in with a bunch of tables. Farther back are higher tables and the bag area. There are more televisions in one place than I've seen. At least fifty of them, all paying miscellaneous sports. 

There is a big selection of beers on draft along with bottles and cocktails. I always get carded here (unsurprisingly) and when I came here days after turning twenty-one, I had yet to have my license changed to the sideways style in NJ. The waitress refused to serve me until I asked to see the manager! Ridiculous. My license was valid, unexpired, and clearly displayed my of-age birth date. 

So the service is really hit or miss every time I've been here. Never spectacular, but the older women always deliver lackluster service it seems.

The food is okay. They have a ton of BBQ and hot sauces. They of course have wings, their main food item. There's also soft pretzels (really bad, oddly sweet tasting - not recommended), fries, potato wedges, a veggie sampler plate, quesadillas, flatbreads, build your own burgers, chicken sandwiches, unappealing salads, and dessert. The dessert is very disappointing. There is mediocre chocolate cake with super thick chocolate fudge frosting (too much chocolate!) or vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup or caramel.

I have pretty much grew up around this area and I can't believe this is my first time here. I always pass it on the pike and decided to give it a try today. It is a small location but the ambiance is gorgeous. The menu is very diverse, lots of special rolls to choose from! I got the Triple Roll that had lobster salad, avocado, cucumber, spicy tuna and salad. DELICIOUS. I also got a shrimp tempura roll which was also yummy. The person who came with me got fried rice and a California roll. What I loved the most was the quality was fantastic and the plating was so nice! Not to mention the sizes of the rolls were perfect, not small at all! I was full off of those two rolls alone! This is definitely my go-to spot for sushi!

I had the white collar roll, and what really impressed me was how delicate and subtle the flavors were. I've never had a roll taste as clean and refreshing.

We waited 35 minutes for the food, and 20 minutes  for the. Heck after we had finished our ""meal"", and I use that term lightly. The food was atrocious. Where to begin... old sliced white bread and dry cornbread in the bread baskets.  The children's pizza was the frozen type, which was burnt on the bottom and  cheese was also burned. None of our kids are it. The chicken scampi was not scampi, but some kind of curry yellow thickened ""gravy""... just awful. Lemon chicken was gray colored, dry and tough... almost inedible. The cheesesteak was not edible... at all... all in all, it was the worst dining experience we've ever experienced. Please save yourself the frustration and money, and eat at another restaurant.

However, As soon as you walk in and see the garlic knots on display and chefs busy behind the counter, your mouth can't  can't help but water. Once the aromas of dough and cheese toasting in the oven hit your nose, it's instant hunger. They are quick, but the quality doesn't suffer.

I gave only 2 stars bc of the following: while entering the restaurant we were not greeted by anyone, no guest in front of us but people started to flow in behind us. Mind you the restaurant had many empty tables. There were 3 host just staring at us, and the manager was facing the host stand with his back to the entry door. It doesn't take a genius to seat guest to the correct server section. 
-while waiting for our food I noticed a guy walking around counting tables, he circled our section 3 times, found out the food was for our table. hmm you work at a restaurant and don't know your table numbers? 
-looking around I noticed that there were alot of workers, servers and hostess standing around doing absolutely nothing! There are so many things to be done...tables cleared and set, checking on tables, clean! Sheesh do something, keep yourself busy! Our table definitely neglected bc we wanted and waited for refills, Togo box, check all took about 20 mins each.

This restaurant is everything you want in a good Jersey Diner. A lunch counter, a mix of tables and booths, baked items right up front on display, bottomless hot strong coffee, and clean restrooms. Yay! It's nicely handicapped accessible as well. 

We went for lunch, so I had the beef liver just to freak everyone out. It came with a salad and two veggies. The salad was very fresh, a nice portion, and the blue cheese dressing above average. It was presented with a piece of cornbread (excellent) and a cheese roll which I handed off to a friend who almost bit his fingers finishing it. I took that as a good sign.

The liver was cooked perfectly, server with fried online and a nice beef gravy that didn't overpower the meat. It was accompanied with mashed potatoes and stewed tomatoes, which I had selected as my veggies. The mashed were good, nothing special, and perfect with the meat. The stewed tomatoes were stewed whole, which was interesting, but then someone went insane with oregano and I might as well have been eating tomato oreganato. I passed on these. 

Dessert was included but I was full. With a soda my meal was under $10, cheaper than some recent fast food lunches and definitely a whole lot tastier.

Not many places like this in the area and I do enjoy catching a game and having some hot wings and a cold beer. From the young hostesses up front to the poor overwhelmed managers, everyone seems like they're in over their heads. Every night seems like 30% of the staff called in sick. Been there probably ten times since opening last June. Was there the first night and it was comical. I don't think anyone got what they ordered, but they seemed to try. Cold beer, cold wings, cold hamburgers... but it should have gotten better by now but it hasn't.  The managers hand out the ""We're sorry"" 6 free wing cards with regularity. One seemed to enjoy bussing tables more than anything else- he kept his head down and avoided the customers with ease. Was there several times where there were a dozen empty tall tables in bar area. We were told we had to wait 20 minutes for a bar table- you guessed it- we waited at one of the empty bar tables- we just had to walk 8 feet to the bar to get our own beer until we were seated at our table which we were already at. Then we got a friendly waitress.  In general, I've found the service in the bar area is much better (faster) than the seated table/booth area.
It's a fun place. Lots of HD TV's, trivia games, sports games etc. Beer selection is decent and drafts are cold and tasty.  Food is OK. Wings are decent and lots of good sauce selections. Some of the waitresses are pretty good.  Seems like an easy formula-serve more beer, serve more wings and customers are happy and staff makes more money.  But ignoring customers, taking 45 minutes for an order of wings, 10 minutes for a beer and handing out free wing coupons for the inconvenience hurts the business model.  
But yes, I'll go back again. I have lots of free wing cards to use ;-)",2012-01-23 23:33:05

A nice sized buffet in the heart of the Sicklerville 'promenade', a group of my work colleagues talked me into joining them today for lunch. The typical $7.99 buffet/sushi/hibachi spread. I will say the sushi was very nice, the fish portions not minuscule and all reasonably fresh. This, plus some extra yummy green beans on the buffet and a clean overall appearance gained the second star.

What tore away all the others? 95% of everything here was deep fried. Including the sushi, which had a lot of tempura rolls. The salad bar consisted of some endive corsley cut up, tomatoes (more on these later) and a cucumber whacked up into 1/2"" slices. Not a big deal if you have a knife, but as we were issued a fork, spoon and chopsticks it was a challenge. 

The waitress had to pick up four sodas and she managed to mess that up. Plates backed up at one point, and there were literally eight people in the place, a family of four and us. Perhaps she was distracted by the daycare event going on in the kitchen where someone's two year old decided it was let's scream around the quiet restaurant day. 

Quality of the food you ask? Green beans? Fresh and good. Sushi, good for a buffet. Salad bar? The tomatoes were rotten. The worst part was they weren't obviously rotten, but when you put it in your mouth all you tasted was summertime garbage can water. I'm not kidding - I can still taste and probably will till I burn it off my palate with some good tequila after work. The rest of the food? Spare ribs were dry, squid was tough, most meats were overcooked and the rest of it was deep fried. 

So in short, and overall bleah experience crowned by the lingering taste of garbage water.

I needed to print an Amtrak ticket and came into the store at 7:45 (it closes at 8:00). I ask to use their printer, and the front desk guy tells me right away ""no can do"" because the circa-2004 desktop computer had been shut down already and he ""always"" turns it off right before the store closes (or in my case 15 minutes before). I counter that the store is still open! He begrudging started the computer up (took a whopping 30 seconds to turn on), I print the ticket from my email, and then go to pay (spent maybe 2 minutes on the computer total). Front desk guy disappeared to the back at that point and came out like 5 minutes later (could you have made it any more obvious you thought having a customer was a big pain in the a** for you?). 

The total came out to be $5.00, for two printed pages! Other UPS stores I had used printing services for charged per page, and I would end up spending, at most, $0.50-$1.00. I was told I wasn't being charged for the paper or ink but for the use of the computer. Huh? I had coupon for X% off a print job, and I'm told the coupon doesn't apply to the service I just used.

Finally the food comes and we ask for silverware. 
The wings were coated in a mild pink sauce and were under done. Skin not crispy,chicken meat was tough and didn't come away the bone easily.

Still waiting for silverware. By this time I tried to eat the wings but after 2 could not eat anymore. So waitress finally returned with silverware I asked for the chicken wings to be put back in the fryer.

The incredible facilities/float experience is SO much cheaper than what I'd paid in LA. Most definitely getting a membership for the few months I have left here. I'll be sad when I have to move back! This place is top notch, and floating there has been one of my favorite experiences.",2020-10-29 14:22:51

The service was cool, considering how insane I have heard it gets here during big sporting events but anyway... The wings? Eh. I feel nothing, I actually have likely had better wings elsewhere. They were just okay, we tried four different flavors and agreed it was cool but nothing worth returning for.

We had the street tacos as an app which were ok, had a kick but nothing special of course.

We got in on their beer of the month (Modelo) which were $6 each for a 24oz. Decent deal but otherwise, i'll likely always pass on BWW. A bit pricey too .. 3 beers, 1 app, and 1 large wing basket for $21 came to $50 something bucks... 

Let me add that they do have an impressive beer selection!!

Went today around lunch time and finally got out of there around dinner time. It wasn't overly crowded and they appeared to be more than sufficiently staffed yet our dining experience was still a 2 hour ordeal between waiting quite a bit of time not only for our food but also refills, checks, etc. Aside from the second-rate service the food itself is the definition of mediocrity (although it is reasonably priced). The most awe-inspiring thing about my trip to B-DubDub is the fact that a business that supposedly prides itself on its wings (its in your name afterall) has the audacity to charge for celery. Yes, 60 cents for celery, those crunchy sticks of basically nothing. Not including celery with wings is like getting salsa but no chips with which to dip in the salsa, or having gravy but no biscuits, all of which are mutually exclusive. If you're going to have the nerve to charge me for celery you could atleast be a little more generous with the servings and perhaps give me more than 4 sticks of celery (that's if the waitress even remembers to bring it out, but we already covered the subpar service). I was a little relieved when I got my check and saw they didn't charge me for water atleast. All-in-all it was a very forgettable.

New Jersey is the land of diners (according to my partner who was on the trip with me and is originally from New Jersey), and as someone on keto I can always find something at a diner!

I was looking for something easy and somewhat light since we were here pretty late and I didn't want to deal with trying to sleep on a super full stomach (and this was only about 45 minutes from our final destination). With that in mind, I went with the Caesar Salad with chicken (no croutons) and some coffee.

The coffee was typical diner coffee (which is the best coffee hands down, besides maybe Wawa...)

The salad was fresh, crisp, and well-sauced (bordered on a little over sauced, but I was hungry for the Caesar flavor, so I wasn't really complaining at the time), and the chicken was bordering on overcooked but was well seasoned and had its very slight dryness overcome by the additional sauce in the salad. This is my first time ever seeing tomatoes come standard on a caesar, though, and I wasn't really feeling that so I didn't end up eating them.

Service was great - I wish I remembered his name, but he was attentive but not aggressive or hovering. The place was pretty dead at that time of night, so I was impressed that he managed to stay busy while not constantly coming by to check on us except when our drinks were low or we looked like we needed something.

I'll probably keep this place in mind the next time I make the trip up to AC if nobody thinks of anything else they specifically want.",2020-01-13 19:50:11

My boyfriend has been really wanting to do this and this is right up his alley, as he spends hours in the tub it seems. I for one cannot sit still for 2 minutes. I found a great deal on Groupon and the place had pretty good reviews. Their website was extremely informative (I love information overload). They had a whole video on what to expect and how to prepare for your float. They also had a really nice online booking system (I'm also all about the least amount of human contact possible). 

So this was a surprise for my boyfriends birthday, we drove out to the location and he was thrilled. Parking is great and their is plenty of other things to do in the area if you are dropping someone off here. Check in was easy, they scanned my voucher and had that all taken care of right away. Jenny was really awesome. She gave both me and my boyfriend a tour of the facilities and really made me feel included even though I wasn't floating. I will actually try it because of her! She went into great detail about the benefits as well as the differences of the pods and tanks. Everything was extremely clean, which is of the highest importance in the spa world. When I went back in to pick my boyfriend up he looked like a new man. When we got home later that day he was already talking abut going back soon.

Thinking that arriving around 5 on Saturday we would walk out pretty quick since it was dull early and not half full but it took almost two hours before we finally in the car. 
  It took over 5 minutes to be acknowledged since the manager/host went off to arrange tables for the group ahead of us and the kid that sat us gave us no option of what we wanted to be seated so the bar area it was. Our waitress was attentive and quick at first but once it got busy we became the red headed step child of her tables. The wrap was barely warm and the fries were as bare as can be (but at least warm). The tortilla seemed straight from the plastic bag with zero flavor or warmth. Each boneless wing my gf had was like a ""choose your own adventure"" of flavor....do you want a hot one? a cold one? how about a tough as jerky one? we got it all here folks just not consistency. The chicken quesadilla was average with no flavor and barely any cheese. I needed to ask for refill and never asked again so gf was SOL with her water but at least she had ice to chew on. 
  Employees texting while delivering drinks, dusty vents above the sticky tables, drink spilled on floor but never cleaned up were more highlights.

According to FourSquare, I checked in here 11 times in 60 days so not counting the times I missed checking it, I go here every 7-10 days (usually more) which should count me as a regular.

First bad visit - we found that our favorite waitress Sherry - who was amazing - was 'out' for a while.  The body language told me that she was likely out for good.  OK, things happen so we sat and ordered.  The pickled beets which we both get as a side were fizzy and slightly sour/spoiled and inedible - so not fresh as always was the case before.  The food was good but service was not great, much slower.

Second bad visit (3/21/13) - the staff looked like it had been decreased even more, part of the room was closed off and we had a new waitress who in spite of taking our simple order with a note pad - had to come back 3 times to the table to check on what she wrote down to get our order right.  She then got my soup (one of two choices) wrong.  

The food was VERY slow to come out and we literally waited over 30 minutes for a grilled chicken breast and a veal/shrimp dish.  The bread basket usually filled with cheese bread, corn bread and regular bread was down to 2 small pieces of cornbread and a roll cut into 4 pieces.

Several other regulars were in the dining room and we all agreed that the service and quality of the food had gone down dramatically in just a couple of weeks

Not sure whats going on but if it doesn't get better the next few visits; we will be going to one of the other area diners.

Please note my earlier review below from 2/22/13 where I gave this place 5 stars!!

OLD REVIEW:

This is a GREAT diner for breakfast, lunch, dinner - and yes, they even have drinks due to their liquor license.

Ever since the Country Club Diner in Voorhees closed, I've tried a number of places to see if I could find one to replace it.  Winslow Family Diner and Restaurant comes close and actually stands very well on it's own.

I have never had to wait for a table whether it was 2 of us of 20 and the service is very good.  We always ask for Sherry - always smiling, friendly, attentive and just awesome.

Great breakfasts (get it often, even for dinner) and large portions of everything as well.  The baked lasagna, Marsala Chicken, onion rings - everything I've had is great.

I can't say enough good things about it - it is a diner and very casual - and it's awesome!

Ask for Sherry and you'll have a great breakfast, lunch or dinner!!!",2013-02-22 16:30:12

They FINALLY had a pizza ready when I got here.. And I've tried NUMEROUS times to go back with NOTHING every ready, and this picture shows you the low standards they have. The dough was not cooked through and not even the decency to put out a decent shaped pie

I was really upset by the fact that they did not have regular strawberry fro-yo since that's really the only flavor I like.  But anywayz.. they only have about 14 total flavors at any given time - nowhere near as many as they advertise on all their menus, but I guess they switch flavors regularly.  After you get your fro-yo (only 2 sizes of cups - large and large as hell - available so be extra careful not to get crazy) they have regular ice cream sundae bar-type toppings including hot fudge and caramel, and on the opposite side of the registers there are fruit and other selections like these fruit juice ball things that apparently explode in your mouth.  

I chose mixed berry something or another (since no strawberry), but later realized that flavor is not fro-yo but sorbet *frowny-face*.  It was pretty good though.  My mother went ""boring"" and chose french vanilla. It was really good.  We ended up sharing a cup since they're soo big, with each of our flavors on a different side.  For future reference, the very berry and french vanilla together are amazing..

The service was ok I guess. I don't have the slightest idea why there are so many tip jars when the whole shebang is self-service, a.k.a. ""DO-IT-YOUR-DAMN-SELF-service"".  If you're nice and ask, they will allow you to taste flavors, but won't let you do it on your own.  *So, fatties like myself can't taste every flavor without feeling guilty or judged.

Nice place to hang out after drinks or dinner at the neighboring restaurants since they close everyday at midnight, even Sundays.  I can see a lot of young kids meeting friends here and taking over though.

Seeing as I'm addicted to soft-serve ice cream, and this is actually a pretty good alternative (health-wise), I'll come back (but these hoes better add Strawberry to the selections).  
Oh, and I think the price is something like $0.49/oz but remember, the cups are huge so don't get carried away. We paid like $5 total and didn't add any toppings.",2012-10-01 05:17:42

Not only did the employees offer guidance on what to do and recommend which product to buy, but when we said we were not planning on keeping the kitten and very unsure of our abilities to care for it well, they immediately stepped in and said that they would take care of it for the night and contact the shelter/animal hospital to get it to the right place safe and sound; all we needed to do was take him to the store. I was so grateful, as my entire family was worrying how to handle and save the kitten since we all work full time and are not knowledgeable when it comes to cats. They knew we wanted the best outcome for the kitten and they took on the responsibility and went above and beyond with their service.

First of all he had stomach pain almost daily for several years as well as very slow weight gain, and I was told that he was making it up for attention.  It turns out after testing at chop that he has several gastrointestinal conditions that were causing this pain and slow growth.  I had to make the appointment at chop on my own because kressville kept blowing off my concerns.  Also, my son had recurring croup while we were patients at kressville.  He was prescribed an albuterol inhaler by the doctors at kressville, which I come to find out actually makes croup worse.  He was also given multiple courses of 5 day prednisone for ""reactive airway"" which I came to find out is the wrong steroid for croup, and also too long of duration.  These meds were unnecessary and detrimental.  The final straw at kressville was when my son had a 7 week long illness.  He had high fevers of 103-104 almost daily for over a month.  He was given 3 courses of steroids during this time, as well as 2 courses of anitbiotics.  When the antibiotics that one doctor prescribed did not work, we were told by another doctor to ""just stop taking them"" after only 3 days being on them.  Several weeks later he was still sick and prescribed antibiotics again.  After 3 days of the second course of antibiotics, I called in to the office because my son still had a 104 degree fever, joint pains, rashes, and non stop coughing.  He had been sick for 6 weeks. I was told by Dr. Hill that since the antibiotic course was 10 days, I shouldn't be calling the office until 10 days have passed! No concern that my son had been sick for 6 weeks.  I ended up going to chop again and found out he had RSV.  All the meds they had pumped him with were useless because he had a virus.

Salted.Mozzarella.Braid.

Call in advance for this one. You can get it same day, but when you call in advance it's better. This cheese brings me back to my childhood days in South Philly when my grandfather would take me on a trolley ride to pick up these braids. The addition of genoa salami to the purchase is all my idea though. 

This store is very small, but it packs quite a punch, armed with various stuffed olives, cheeses, peppers, packaged goods, homemade frozen Italian dishes, gravies, soups, garlic bread...everything you'd expect in a South Philly salumeria. 

This time of year (November/December) they have homemade Italian Ricotta cookies--ignore the price and get them anyway.

When I lived at home I frequented two nail salons, so I called them prior to ending up here but they both had waits of 1hr+. I pulled up and saw that there was no one inside so I decided to take a chance. That was a mistake. The man who did my nails was insanely rude. Throughout the entirety of him doing my refill, he spoke one word to me which was ""go"" when I needed to wash my hands. Everything else was a series of grunts and points. The real kicker was the fact that in the midst of it he pretty much annihilated one of my cuticles with the buffer. I flinched and was met with him pulling my hand back toward him.

The only worker in the place (8pm on a Saturday evening) was reading a book behind the counter when we walked in. There were a few patrons sitting in the seats. We grabbed our cups and started with the ice cream/yogurt machines. They were sticky messes. The handles and drop trays were covered with mess. The dry topping canisters looked like they had not been cleaned in some time. The handles were sticky and the area that the toppings came out of were crusted with ice cream/frozen yogurt. 

We moved on to where the cereals and other toppings were on the other side of the counter. To say it was a mess was an understatement. The toppings were spilled together and spoons and containers just looked sticky, gooey, dirty and unsanitary. There were cherries all over the counter. 

Right at the register.....where the worker was seated...... is where the hot fudge, caramel sauce etc....was located. Containers were dirty and sticky and looked like they didn't fit together properly. Really sloppy. 

My husband paid for our creations - $24 and change - for 4 people. We decided that all of the empty tables were too unsanitary to sit at so we left. We came home to eat our treats.....

I had chocolate and vanilla swirl frozen yogurt as did my husband. All of the toppings that you could put on this sludge couldn't hide the fact that it tasted freezer burnt. Like it had spent more than its allowable time in the machine. 

The longer I thought about it, the more concerned I became. If the sanitary conditions of the physical store locations were allowed to look like this, they certainly could not be maintaining the cleanliness of these machines as they should. The listeria that could be coming out of these machines could make a lot of people sick. I promptly gathered all of our barely touched treats and dumped them down the sink.

BEWARE- what was sold to me as a $0 out of pocket procedure after insurance payments ended being $1,415 that I was billed by their office.

My two children had wisdom teeth extracted in early January 2019.   We had our initial consultation on 11-15-2018 and were provided an estimate by her staff, after they consulted with our insurance company, of $0 out of pocket. 

The surgery was scheduled for 1-4-2019 and just days before the surgery (and days after Christmas) I received a call from her office advising that their estimate had been revised to $1,156.00.

While I was unhappy, the surgery had to be done so we went ahead with it and paid this $1,156.00  amount.

6 weeks later, I received another bill for $259.00 so I called the office and spoke with Kenya in billing.  Kenya advised that this was a balance due from the 1-4-2019 surgery because of a balance that the insurance company did not pay.  When I pressed her on why we are receiving a 2nd revision on the initial estimate, making this estimate/bill #3 for the same procedure, she became argumentative and kept saying that it was just an ""estimate"". 

I understand how estimates work, however why not do it right the first time? 

I have never had a provider deviate from their preliminary estimate and I NEVER would have chosen this practice had I known that they would continue to bill for additional funds after having received their estimate from our insurance company.",2019-03-25 15:31:26

Here are the substitutions that I wanted but could not get incase you are interested:
For the big dinner box I wanted another order of breadsticks instead of wings but they said no.
I got the 3 pizzas instead and each comes with up to one topping. I asked if I could just get three toppings on one pizza, and they said no. When I tried to get a few added toppings (I think 4 or 5 meats) the order came to over $40! Adding meats DOUBLED the price of 3 pizzas  so I took off the extras and just got two plain pizzas and one with one topping.

They have some good deals but variety is limited and added toppings increases the price way too much.",2021-03-21 00:52:08

Either way you order, your food will take a little while to come out. BUT the wait is so worth it. Whether your food is fried or broiled, it's absolutely delicious. The service is good. The owner is usually present whenever I go. He is very personable and helpful. The ambience is usually dim and intimate. Seating inside is pretty spacious. There are both booths and tables to eat at accommodating plenty of people. To top things off, Taste and Sea is a BYOB. Parking is never an issue.

I mean Subway or Quiznos aren't the worst places in the world, but they generally don't hold a candle to a proper deli. My coworker South Philly Roy talked me into trying Primo, actually buying my first sandwich. Now SP Roy earns his title because he can find anything you could possibly want in South Philly and claim it's much better because of it. Being that my girlfriend is also from South Philly, any Roy story flaunting the positive attributes of South Philly (as opposed to the parking situation) is immediately confirmed. Now that I've completely confused you, I should note that Primo Hoagies started in South Philly. 
Now if you're read any of my other reviews you know that I am a fat guy and fat guys don't pass on free lunch. It's a rule, you pass on free lunch you lose your frequent heart attack card. 
Well Primo's Hoagies won me over...I've eaten there several times since. The meat is fresh sliced, the bread is good and firm, it's a hearty sandwich that warms my cholesterol clogged arteries. When I moved to Sicklerville I was excited to find a Primo's down the street from me. Unfortunately this is where the stars start falling..... Now I have pretty high expectation of service driven business, but I'm not a complete jerk. I realize that if I walk into Primo at 12:30 that I am going to wait a hot minute for my sandwich. However  a couple things I find unacceptable is waiting 20+ mins for a sandwich. It's a friggen sandwich for god sake- in 20 mins. I could go home, start my grill, grill a steak and have it on the plate and trust me it would be a much more satisfying than a silly sandwich. One time after waiting 20+ mins, and watching people who came in before me leave, I asked the girl behind the register what the hold up was. This is when she decided to stop texting for a moment and check, only to find my sandwich was sitting 3 feet from her. The kicker is that I remember them putting the sandwich there over 10 mins before. She was too busy updating her facebook status with ""OMG smells like vinegar in here"" to do her job.
 I am impatient so I often call my order in so I can get in and out. Well I called up about a month ago around 2 in the afternoon and after giving my order they tell me it's going to be 30-45 mins!!!!!!!! for one sandwich. I cancelled my order and went elsewhere...I haven't been back since. I don't like to tell anyone their business, but if it takes you 30 mins to get a sandwich out you have a staffing problem. Suppose you're on a 30 min lunch break. You need your lunch in 10 mins if you're going to get a chance to eat it. I hope they realize this and work on fixing the problem. It's a shame that their sh!tty service overshadows their tasty sammies...",2009-06-04 13:33:58

Service was done through the drive up window and it was fast. Also, the order was delivered perfectly. Nice! 

We shared the fries - a regular size was enough for two. I'm not usually a fan of waffle fries, but these were cooked perfectly. Also, nice.

The chicken was freshly cooked, tender end hot. I was surprised because we were driving up between the lunch rush and the dinner crowd. 

We ordered a large cole slaw and it was a good size for two people who really like their slaw. The best thing was how many times we looked at each other and said, ""this is good cole slaw"". 

I am reluctant to give chain restaurants 5 stars because so much of the fare is corporate driven. However, a good crew with a strong manager can raise the quality above the norm and our experience today was very positive. That's why there are 5 stars.

I have been here quite a few times since it opened this past summer but I am always disappointed in their prices. I always order the taco meal (comes with 2 tacos, drink, and a small side), my husband always orders just a burrito (not the meal, just one burrito) and my daughter orders the kids burrito. I don't know why but I am always surprised that our meal costs almost $30! They have a rewards card which is great because every few months I can get $5 off my order.  There are no refills on the small bag of tortilla chips that you pay for with your meal and they are often stale. 

I will always choose California Tortilla over its competitors in the Sicklerville area, however, I am not happy with spending a fortune on a couple of tacos and a burrito.",2015-02-08 02:12:14

All of the doctors and staff are very nice and do their best to accommodate the needs of me and my pet.

This is a fairly large practice which is good because they have good hours and can usually get you an appointment quickly if you have a sick pet.  

My only gripe is that because it is a large practice it is not uncommon to get a different doctor each visit.  Fortunately they are all excellent, but if you are dealing with a pet with chronic issues, it can be helpful to see the same person.   I suppose it is possible to schedule appointments to see the same person, but often with a pet it is easier to schedule appointments when it is most convenient to get there and not around when any particular doctor is available.

The location is fairly convenient, on Cross-Keys on the same corner as the ShopRite.  Since they have a small parking area, it is usually easier to pull into the ShopRite plaza and park there behind the vet office as the lots are connected.",2009-04-04 16:31:20

I first came here when they opened in March-ish of 2013 to see what it was all about, and I instantly fell in love with the store. They have little dog-related novelties, like bumper magnets, leashes, harnesses, collars, coffee mugs, and other cute things for both humans and dogs. 

But their main speciality, and the favorite of both my dogs and myself, are their dog treats! They have such a wide variety of dogs treats, all made in-house, that look delicious enough to be for humans. For my Pomeranian Waffles' birthday last December, I got him a little ""chocolate"" (made from carob, a chocolate-like ingredient that is safe for dogs, and used in human food too) cupcake, with sprinkles and all. He LOVED IT! I also got my other five dogs (two family dogs, Pomeranian-Min Pin & Basenji, my other Pomeranian, and my Dad's girlfriend's Cocka-Poo and Lhasa-Poo) cupcake-like cookie treats to celebrate Waffles' birthday, and they loved their treats as well. 

I've gone in multiple times after my first few visits in 2013 to get my dogs their newly-found favorite treats from K-9 Kakes. Their speciality treats are all designed with colored icings, and cute seasonal designs and sprinkles. They currently have fall themed cookies and treats available; cookies shaped like ghosts, and bone shaped cookies with orange icing, and white ""Boo"" icing-text on them - so cool. They also have basic looking dog biscuits that come in Carob (the dog-safe chocolate I mentioned previously), vanilla, peanut butter, and multiple other seasonal flavors. You can buy bags that contain one flavor, or a ""grab bag"" that contains a mixture of all of the flavors, which my dogs love, so they can get a little bit of everything. 

As I mentioned, all of their dog treats are made in-house by the owner, who is a super cool gentleman, who is (maybe) in his mid-to-late fifties, judging off of him telling me he grew up in the 60's ;) I've spoken with him multiple times throughout my visits -- he is very friendly and knowledgable when it comes to the products he offers. He is more than happy to explain the ingredients in all of the treats, just in case your dog has any allergies, or if you're just curious, like I was. He is the one who is explained their ""chocolate"" being Carob, and gave me a rundown on what Carob actually is, hence my brief explanation earlier in my review. He definitely knows what he is doing when it comes to making these delectable doggy treats, as they look amazing and taste great (judging solely by my dogs reactions to the treats!)

It is also my understanding that they do offer custom doggy birthday cakes, of which I will be ordering this December for Waffles' 3rd birthday :) I flipped through some pictures they had of cakes they've made during one of my visits, and they are just as amazing looking as all of the cookies they offer.

Hopefully my adding of this business to Yelp help gets their name out there. They really have an amazing thing going, and their product really speaks for itself! I've been to many other dog bakery-like places, all of which were either overpriced, or didn't carry great products, like K-9 Kakes does. K-9 Kakes is fairly priced with great products. I would honestly pay more than what their prices are for what they offer. Example: 4 medium sized speciality cupcake shaped cookies (with colorful icing and sprinkles) and a medium bag of miscellaneous flavored cookies came to $8; works for me.

All in all, I love every aspect of this place; from the product, to the selection, and the awesome, knowledgable, personable owner. I hope their name continues to get out there, and more people and their pets can enjoy what K-9 Kakes has to offer. 


*Excuse any typos or grammatical errors this review may contain. I had 4 dogs pawing at my legs and computer, barking at me relentlessly, begging for more K-9 Kakes' treats!*

Went in for our puppy's 2nd birthday and was instantly impressed with how clean the store is.   A couple people had their dogs with them and Dave the Baker was more than happy to let the pups sample a few of the treats before their owners made their purchases.  

I asked Dave about the ingredients and how the treats are made and he gave me a full run-down of what's in them and how there's nothing in any of their treats that has any harmful impact on dogs.  

I ended up purchasing a couple of different treats for the birthday girl and when paying offered a tip or to go grab cash due to the low total which Dave politely refused.

I had the fajitas with steak & chicken. The 2 skinny strips of steak were very chewy and grisly, and the 2 strips of chicken were dry and not very flavorful. The side rice was very dry, and the black beans were undercooked. The flour tortilla was the saving grace, and I wish they had given me more of them. The sauce wall with many different choices of sauces and a guidebook is innovative.

I went in today (9/2/15) at 5:20 pm to get my eyebrows wax. So most places when you get your eyebrows wax, they will have you go to a  secluded room to do the waxing.  So when the man said take a seat back there I went to the wrong area. I was laying down in the waxing seat. The guy came into the room and said can you get and and go to the chair over there. There was no please or anything. 

I apologize for my mistake and take in the area where people where getting their nails done, but towards the back. He began to go my eyebrows and used a cotton ball with alcohol then waxed it. Then went the the other eyebrow with wax to wax it. I began ask why didn't he use the rubbing alcohol with the other eyebrow, but I was ignored. 

Finished the eyebrows with the  tweezers and handed me the mirror. Now, on my left eyebrow there was surgery, so there's a surgery line and  hair above it. The right side is normal. It's painfully obvious that the eyebrows don't match. But with the man not caring I simply said I'll fix my own eyebrows at home. Then he fixed it. 


Get in my car before I pulled off and see there are 4 noticeable globs of wax above and below my eyebrows. He did. It clean up his mess.

First off, the California Tortilla is one of the cleanest inside. There is a wall stacked with a numerous selection of hot sauces (which is something I do love about Mexican food) and it is well-organized and clean. However, the bottle I opened had an expiration date 2 months prior to me opening it. I wasn't too concerned about this and not sure anyone else should be either. 

I tried the turkey chilly accompanied with ""How big is your stinger?"" Hot sauce. Lol the name sold me haha. There sauce is labeled at a 9 as being very spicy to beware. In my opinion, it was the right amount of spice to add to the chili and it had a unique sweetness that was amazing. 

My lady chick had a pork burrito, which was the size of a football. It was full of flavor, according to her. She said it was much tastier than the one Chipotle used to offer.

I had a new Lennox heater and AC unit installed in 2017 and these guys did excellent job. Not a single issue in two years. It was very tough job to remove the old heater from my attic. They do not cut corners and install things the right way the first time. If you know something about your home equipment you can appreciate a neat, well done installation which is as important as the equipment itself. 
I picked this company in the first place because I felt trust to Frank, the owner, who did the estimate for me and gave me straight and reasonable price and no gimmicks (like some big companies around). The guys are very friendly and do not mind to give useful tips about how to maintain your equipment.",2019-09-27 15:02:09

I've been to my fair share and beyond of CFA locations and have seen the craziness that events like Spirit Nights can bring but this one took the cake and then some.  The drive thru line wrapped around the store and every parking space was gone.

Now of course I was going to turn around back onto Cross Keys Road and head elsewhere but I noticed something.  Considering how off the wall things were, the drive thru line was actually moving, very slowly I might add but indeed it was moving.

The secret was having two people standing outside with laminated menu cards and iPad type devices taking orders along with any CC payments and another person standing outside by the pick up window sort of expediting the orders to make sure that everyone was getting everything they needed.

This system worked perfectly to keep things moving along and at the very least our order was 100% accurate, tasted as usual CFA perfect and the overall wait time wasn't nearly as bad as I expected.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, screw the CEO's asinine political views because this chain knows customer service and they know how to pump out excellent fast food (oxymoronic I know) at a reasonable price.

This place is consistently terrible, with some of the rudest, most incompetent associates I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with. But this review will focus only on our latest experience.

We went in around 7pm on Black Friday, which maaaaay account for some of the problems, but there were seriously so many, this cannot be excused. We were shopping for all new cabinets to redo the kitchen. Headed straight to the appropriate dept and literally (no exaggeration here) stood in the aisle for AT LEAST 30 minutes trying to figure out the right configuration of cabinets/drawers needed without a single person asking if we needed help even though we saw a minimum of 8 people walk past the aisle and see us down there. Mind you, we literally had 20 boxes of cabinets down from the shelves in the aisle and there were 4 of us, so it would be kind of hard to not notice us. They seriously had to make an effort to ignore us. Once we had sorted everything out, we pressed the ""call for help"" button since apparently that was the only way to get assistance around there. When no one showed up, my husband went to a nearby section and told someone we needed assistance. That employee and the one responding to the call button naturally showed up at the same time, and they were both surly and unpleasant. One of them actually said, right in front of us, in a very annoyed tone, that she was still on lunch but that she could do it. 

So we explained that we needed 2 cabinets down from the higher shelves and 1 ordered since it was out of stock. On that note, let me say that their stock is embarrassing. They did have quite a good selection, however, every other box we pulled out was torn open either by careless employees or customers trying to look inside, and at least 25% of the cabinets had at least some type of damage on some part of the product.

Anyway, by the time the girl got the forklift out and gotten the 2 boxes down, we had been waiting at least another 25 minutes. She was so slow, and it was so obvious that she did not want to be there helping us. I told my parents they should just walk away and not buy anything from them if they want to have that attitude, but they decided they had gone this far, may as well just be done with it. 

The next day we received a phone call from Lowes regarding the special order we placed for the cabinets that they didn't have in stock. The girl who called was completely confused about the invoice she had in her hand: did we know if the order was placed? How the hell would I know if your employees did their job?! She then told us if we didn't pay for it in advance, they weren't ordered. Well, that would have been nice of them to tell us the night before, wouldn't it. But this girl did give us the option to give her our credit card over the phone so she could place the order. No thanks.

Overall, between the attitudes and the incompetence, I would stay away from this Lowes. There is another one literally like 5 miles away.",2012-11-29 17:13:14

I just wanted to send a note regarding check # 97029 from the Sicklerville, NJ location.  My wife simply requested that the lettuce and tomato be ""on the side"" for our whole Audie.  We just wanted to ensure that our roll wasn't soggy when we were ready to eat our hoagie.  

The counter person responded that the lettuce and tomato couldn't be packed ""on the side,"" but our hoagie would be travel wrapped, per company policy.  I would have the question the reliability of the travel wrapping process.  We were presented with a roll that was mush when we were ready to eat our hoagie.  It was so soft and wet that we could not even pick it up to eat it.  

Needless to say, Primo Hoagies lost our business for not being able to respond to a simple customer request.  I understand company polices are in place for a reason.  However, I would assume that building repeat business would be paramount.

The positive side of this story is that we went to a local pizza parlor for dinner.  We were able to have a decent meal in an establishment that seemed to truly appreciate our business.  Once again, I have been steered to a local business by the poor performance of a chain location.",2013-08-28 23:03:28

You come in, an Asian woman tells you to pick a color, and you sit there for a while while they cement artificial appendages to your fingertips.

I walked in, nail-less, without an appointment at 2 pm on a friday, and walked out at 3 with a very well done full set of American manicured nails.  For $27, no complaints here.      

The shop itself is relatively new, and they have about a million chairs, so I'm sure they're very well equipped to handle lots of traffic.  As for my manicure itself, the result was great, but the process was less than glamorous.  She did my nails very quickly and proficiently, without cutting me or hurting me whatsoever (which is great - I usually tend to walk out of salons with a bloody cuticle or two), but it was also very no-frills.  Her tools weren't ""dirty,"" but I wouldn't call them clean.  But that's true of pretty much every nail joint I've ever been to.  Also, she cut the nail tips with a pair of office scissors, rather than a nail cutter,  which i found incredibly odd.... but hey, it worked.

The sandwich definitely destroys Subway/Quiznos in flavor and quality, the proportion of a primo is equivalent to a footlong, and definitely worth the extra price. It does fall short in the hot sandwich/toasting department, and Philadelphia has a reputation for providing really great quality sandwiches. 

I'll be honest, the kicker for me is that last month I went to Lenny's Italian Deli in Conshohocken, and that sandwich was absolutely mouth-watering good for the same price as Primo. This deli would do really well if franchised to college towns or maybe a few stores in DC.

I was buying a good few bottles of wine for a special occasion. On the way to the register a bottle of  Merlot wine fell out of the top section of the cart onto the floor and broke into many pieces at my feet. I was wearing suede flip flops. I apologized numerous times and helped with the clean up, sopping up wine with paper towels given to me by the cashier, and gathering glass pieces while the manager went to get a bucket and mop. My pant leg was soaking wet with wine and there was glass all over the place When I got to the register, I was told I had to pay for that bottle of wine  ( $12.)Not talking about a $200. bottle of wine.  Just a plain old $12 bottle of Middle Sister Merlot. I was more than surprised that I was required to pay, but pay I did. I also told the cashier that I would prefer not to purchase the rest of the items I had intended to because I thought the customer service & store policy was unsatisfactory. I left the store and walked a few steps and realized I had glass shards on the bottom of my foot. I went back in and asked if I could fill out a report about what had occurred in the store. Immediately, an attitude was taken by the staff ""you were fine when you walked out of here"" . I replied that I would be able to get the shards out of my foot. I was not looking to sue anyone. I just wanted a report on file. First I was told they ran out of report forms. They were waiting to get one. Fifteen minutes later  I was told their policy is to NOT fill out  incident/accident report forms. I asked if I could please have their names so if I called and was able to speak to someone higher up than that manager I would need the names of  the cashier and manager. They repeatedly refused. The cashier mocked me, did some kind of weird dance move and said ""MY NAME IS ..'.ALWAYS'."" and spelled it out in a sing-song fashion.  The manager threatened to call police because I would not leave the location. I had already called the police to report this incident. There were two liquor salesmen in the store at the time and a few customers. I was at the front of the store and I said to the customers in line something to the effect "" You should not spend your money in this place. Employees are rude and their policies are horrible"" This is all on video tape. The liquor salesmen and the store employees were laughing at me. I was extremely upset and crying and probably having some sort of panic attack. I have never in my life been treated like this. This not only ruined  the celebratory mood of the day. A new baby was about to arrive into this world that afternoon. Hence, ""The Middle Sister"" wine. It also inflicted grief on my husband whom I called at his place of employment numerous times while this was happening. I gave my phone number to the police and the manager of another Roger Wilco  whom I had called. Upon returning home I received a phone call from the owner of the Sicklerville location. I explained the ordeal. He said I was also at fault for telling customers not to shop there. He also said his manager acted as he should have and the cashier would be"" written up"" He then offered that I could drive about 20 miles to another one of his stores and receive a bottle of wine that broke ""for free"" .
I declined. I ended the phone call on a note of I'm appalled & should not have been treated this way. I was nice to him. I am a nice person. I told him if he had people like this working for him it was probably not a smart business move. A day that should have been joyful was spoiled miserably. I wound up with a migraine from crying and was literally sick to my stomach all night. That's Roger Wilco in Sicklerville NJ, DEFINITELY NOT a place for decent people to shop.

I also tried the grilled chicken sandwich too! I liked the grilled chicken better because it had a little more seasoning to it and it also made me feel healthy. 

The waffle fries were pleasant; not overly salty and there were a wide variety of different sauces to choose from that could have been used.

While admittedly, Winslow animal hospital is not my regular veterinary care provider, I have use them for physical therapy and laser treatment for Abb's condition. After the first four treatments, I have seen a significant difference in Abbie's gait. She no longer seems like she is not using her back legs to their full potential. there are underwater aqua therapy and  laser treatment on her spine seem to be the right combination to keep her as The still fairly active 12-year-old Dalmatian that she is. I am very happy with the progress, as well as the TLC received by Linda and Amy. I did meet with Dr. Coudre prior to the beginning of treatment with WAH. He gave her a thorough examination, and saw the same deficiencies that my own veterinarian saw. He agreed that this was the right course of treatment for her. though I did have issue with a younger member of the office staff initially, the matter has become resolved. Just know that if you should become a new client, you may not write a check until you've done business with them for at least six months. apparently, they've been beat before and I don't blame them, but I was not made aware of that fact before I got there. And I really did not want to use a credit card. Had I known all that at the start I would certainly have brought cash along. That was the only issue that I had. It is now resolved, and everything is fine. I feel their pricing is reasonable, but when you have to have multiple services of course it can get pricey. They charge approximately $50 per service. Not per hour, (that was another  point of confusion ) If the therapist thinks that 20 minutes would do rather than a full half hour, that's what you'll get. More time is not necessarily always better. They know what they're doing and have provided significant relief for my girl!",2014-09-18 12:59:13

I have been a customer of this practice for 20 years. Many of the veterinarians at this practice are good hearted, kind and compassionate. But McBee has ruined my outlook and trust in this practice. The treatment on the last two visits are not what a trusted veterinarian practice should offer it's customers. This year During my puppy wellness visits one veterinarian gave us information and instructions that were of sound advise and we agreed to the treatment plan. The veterinarian took into account our views and our own experiences to come up with a plan that would work for us and is based on correct and proper veterinarian care currently used. The next puppy wellness visit, McBee disregards and denounces the puppy plan we have discussed with other veterinarians.  She further disregarded any of our thoughts and objections to what had been discussed and McBee gave us what I can only say was ""her options are the only correct way.  I understand veterinarians may have different opinions but everyone should be on the same page and given options and not just Mcbees way. We left feeling confused and a little angry that one veterinarian would totally discredit another veterinarian within the same practice. 
I am leaving and going to another veterinarian 
On Friday We had called a week before to schedule an appointment and explained that our dog had been limping and that we had given her a week or so, to see if she improved, but was not getting better. When we got to the appointment, we were told that x-rays couldn't be done and we'd have to come back. Why then did the appointment time we picked not have X-ray technicians available? Why then did the surgical team that administers a sedative already go home for the night? If we were told that all services may not be available, we would have scheduled accordingly.
I told both technicians and veterinarian McBee that the pet needs to be muzzled during the exam. They did not listen.
Needless to say the pet was highly active and struggled and was starting to become aggressive on the exam table. 
A veterinarian is a specialist in animal care and treatment. What about a pet owner? Would not a pet owner be a Subject Matter Expert on their pet and it's behaviors. Should not a request and recommendation from me about a muzzle be tried?
I clearly told the first technician that all prescriptions would be filled at a local pharmacy. the second technician walks in and explained all the meds that they were sending home. A ""goodie bag"" as she said. Really? Once again no one listened to me. I informed her that as previously stated as well as in previous business with this practice we have asked for the prescriptions to be sent to the local pharmacy. The look of aggravation on the technician's face could not be covered up by her face mask. Why is the lack of communication between your employees my fault? 
While waiting in the lobby to check out, this same second technician walks up to the lobby attendant and begins to whisper.  Not sure ...but the body posture, hushed tone, slight glance towards me, and the previous reactions in the exam room all lead me to believe she was whispering about me. 
As I checked out I asked if the prescriptions would be called in to the local pharmacy. The lobby attendant goes into the back and comes out and says ""we will have to give you written prescriptions, there wouldn't be anyone here to call the pharmacy till Monday morning"".  Really? If I hadn't asked and went Saturday to get the prescriptions at the local pharmacy... I can just guess the prescriptions would have never been called in. 
Saturday I get a phone call from the practice telling me 9am (no earlier or later) for drop off. News to me. Last night I was told 9am by the lobby attendant but didn't get specific requirements that it HAS to be 9am. I will get it done and we will be there I tell the caller. 
Then a email comes with the confirmation information. It isn't just a 9am drop off and we will call you... it is a 20 minute process during which they will let me speak to the attendants about what can be expected and the treatment plan. Oh and 50% deposit. Treatment plan? You haven't even taken the x rays yet. 
With that email I was feed up. I made a call to a local veterinarian practice. Explained my Pet and it's behaviors and training and my recommendation of a sedation and X-ray. After twenty minutes had a appointment for Tuesday. Sedation, X-rays and the appointment with the veterinarian on findings and treatment if they find anything. All together, no comeback later. WOW. Lot different then Winslow.

I would have normally used the app but it is crap and they don't often get my order at this store. After waiting in a long line (which is unusual for this store) I was told by the cashier I could have done every thing at the pick online/phone order sign I first went to. So I go to this sign to pick up my food after paying and explained what the cashier had told me. One of the employees got very defensive and told me that she would not have told me that. So I repeated yes she did. At that point this employee became very rude and I guess she was calling me a liar saying the cashier would not have told me that. Well, I was at the cashier's station and she was not.  Either way an employee should NEVER argue with a customer/guess in a business, I have issues with my orders not being received via the app. Or even take longer than usual when dinning in at this store. Yet I still go there because most of the employees and the owner are friendly. I think the staff should be re-trained in customer employee relations. For that rudeness today I can only give 3 stars.

I made an appointment 3 days prior as the didn't have openings or pay an additional $70 bucks for ""emergency visit"". I arrived 5 mins. early and waited about 45 mins. but they were busy and I was patient. When the doctor came in to see my dog before even looking at his infected ear she opened his mouth and said that the dog had gum disease and needed at least 2 teeth removed and asked if I wanted an estimate to have the procedure done. Of course I said yes and they gave me an estimate of $910. and explained that the cost could be significantly higher if they ran into complications and they assured me that they WOULD surely run into complications. I was crushed as $1000 bucks or more was way out of my budget and was contemplating what personal possessions I could sell to keep my dog alive. The bill came to 
$245 and insisted I book the surgical procedure for his teeth.  I then took the dog to Petsmart across the street and had him groomed and the groomer advised having his teeth cleaned. I asked about her opinion on the extractions and her answer was ""no, but they do need to be cleaned"". The ear infection came back a few weeks later and I decided to try Cross Keys Animal Hospital to take care of my pooch and the doctor told me I was doing a good job of flushing the ear with 50% water and 50% apple cider vinegar and prescribed antibiotics and steroids and to continue the apple cider vinegar and water flush 3 times a week. I then asked her to check his teeth and she said they could use a good cleaning but no extractions were necessary. I then explained what the doctor at Winslow Animal Hospital recommended and she said to book a cleaning at my convenience because the dog had been eating hard Dentu-Stix and Pig ears like they were potato chips and had no sign of pain or distress on his teeth. I made this post to expose Winslow Animal Hospital for being grossly misleading and money grubbing mercenaries who sought to take advantage of a senior citizen and his senior dog. Yes they were kind and polite but tried to rip me off and that is the bottom line. Look at the other reviews here that are quite old and not so great. BUYER BEWARE!!",2019-05-01 17:10:11

Came here after reading some good reviews, located in a strip mall which is usually the case for nails salons. I had called before and they told me gel manicure was $22 and as advertised on their screen when you enter. I got a basic gel manicure that would have usually cost $25 at other salons but they charged me $35. I was surprised and a little taken back considering I didn't get anything special done. With tip it came to $42 which I think is ridiculous for a basic gel manicure. The girl who did it was nice, but wasn't very good at it. She cut my cuticle too deep and it started bleeding. Multiple times she cut to close and it hurt. She was also very messy, lines weren't neat and nail polish ended up on my skin. Definitely will not be coming back again.

Update: So the salon got in touch with me and told me the girl charged me the wrong price and she thought I got powder. Umm what?? Do you not even know what service you are providing and there's a BIG difference between powder and gel mani. The owner was very accommodating and nice(that's why I gave two stars), he gave me the option of voiding the transaction or just crediting me the additional she charged for the next visit. He was pushing for the credit for next visit but that would mean I would have to get my nails done there again and get me cuticles torn apart again.

At a whopping $41 give or take a few pennies-4 street tacos; one burrito; one kids cheese quesadilla; one side of chips and nacho cheese fresh out of the can and one side of chips and what appeared to be guacamole and more or less tasted of bland baby food and the side of rice and black beans which was conveniently left out of our pick up order bag...you can rest assured we will not be returning anytime soon.  If the overall taste of fish is something you're after or the lack of seasoning and spices in of all things 'fresh Mex' is your bag-by all means rape your wallet here.  So disappointing.  Really hoped for a better outcome.  Sad. Just sad. Looks like we're ordering a pizza now for dinner. Ugh.",2020-03-11 22:44:13

First off, this is a gorgeous location with a nice semi-private room in the back. It looked like the perfect place for me to settle in and work remotely. I usually make 2-3 purchases averaging $15-$20 for the day, and leave tips for the staff to offset my ""camping"".

The problem started when I went back for my usual refill, which I usually complement with an extra order so that they have the added sale. I was told by the barista that because I had a Venti Hot Chocolate, they couldn't accommodate my request for a Tall coffee refill and had to charge me. I had not left the store, and I know the rules (see http://customerservice.starbucks.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1882) but when I asked them to check with a senior staffer, I got the same answer. Their attitude became slightly brusque and I decided to just pay up before I was humiliated any further.

The lady behind me loudly asked if someone could please help her, because despite the fact that there were only two people in line and 4 staffers, only one person was working the register while the other 3 socialized amongst themselves. The barista helping me then argued for a little bit with the others about who was managing the store because it was afternoon and they were completely out of Pike Place and nobody had checked or set a fresh pot to brew. I was even being accommodating by not insisting on a pour-over (I much prefer their Dark coffees to Pike Place, but didn't want to be a bother) but I ended up waiting 5+ minutes anyway.

It's a shame, because with properly trained staff this could be a great location. As it stands, I will not be returning here.

Also to Phil B.'s point, sadly it is not illegal to sell products after their ""Best Before"" date. FDA only provides strict guidelines on baby formula. However, it's certainly skeevy, and there are better businesses out there that deserve my patronage.",2015-04-01 22:45:48

Much nicer than than the appearance of the front.  Too hot to sit outside so we sat at a table by the bar.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive, she was great.  The food is the main reason for 3*s.  She got a very well done Prime Rib ($24) problem is she ordered it Med Well.  It was delicious and somehow still juicy but overcooked.  That seemed to be a theme here bc my Seafood combo ($27) was over cooked as well.  The shrimp, the lobster, the fish, and even the scallops were all over cooked. smh. It was all very good too!  If they had just cooked both dishes properly this could easily be almost (keyword almost) 5*s...  I guess Im not angry bc I had a groupon.

I found this take out about a year or so ago. It's not easily spotted if you don't already know about it. It's located in a strip mall next to other small stores. 

Since my first time here, I've been coming back for more and more. 

Environment/Food/Service: Just your typical Chinese take out. They do have 2 tables inside for people to eat in I believe, but I usually only see people taking out. I've came here from week days to weekends. It's slower on the week days, and tends to get busy on weekend nights. The people that work are pretty friendly. Always very welcoming towards me. They don't speak 100% English, but well enough to communicate. Food has always been awesome since the first time I came! I would recommend their general tsos chicken and egg foo young! Their vegetables are usually pretty fresh too. Prices are fair too, they have a lot of combinations and specials on their menu. Definately check those out too. Oh another plus is there coupons! Hello, freebies? Depending on how much you spend you get a free 2 liter or wonton soup or pork fried rice or even their grandfather chicken. (Yummmm)

Overall I really enjoy this little take out. And I will be coming back for more everytime I get that craving for some Chinese! (Which is quite often)",2013-03-23 00:22:55

In my opinion any diner or pizza place in the area will make a cheese steak for half the price with double the meat and cheese for half the price. And it will taste better as well... All you are doing is paying for the name and don't get me wrong... I'll pay more for a brand name but when it comes to food steer clear! Food was over priced and sub par...

If you want the Tony Luke's busy experience from TV,go to the South Philly location. It's a laid back ambience here. This location is perfect for quick cheesesteak.There's plenty of parking in front for customers. I give Tony Luke's a 3.5 rating.",2016-07-06 04:11:08

Was super excited to see this location, which is right around the corner from my parents. Been wanting to try Tony Luke's for a while and here was my chance! The store was clean, there were tables, and the waiting area was a bit cramped - this place definitely had a ""fast food"" feel, since you get a ticket and have to wait around for your order to be called. Also, the tables are not regularly cleaned, so you either have to find a table that ONLY has crumbs, or clean it yourself.

The cheesesteak itself had a great texture, but the meat was sadly quite bland. The fried onions didn't add anything - not flavor, not texture... very strange. The bread was good - not amazing, but definitely the right kind (and only available in the Philly area).

I ordered a large (9 inches - $8). Definitely get American cheese. I was feeling adventurous and thought - ""let me try the sharp provolone... yeah.. bad idea. Why don't I ever learn to stick with what I know works? Then again, I am not sure who would ever order the sharp provolone... maybe they should take it off the menu?"" [End stream of consciousness]. I went back up and ordered another cheesesteak w/ American cheese, which melted correctly, (the provolone cooled very quickly, which meant you got the chewy cheese w/ every bite). I let them know that the cheesesteak w/ the sharp provolone did NOT taste good - they didn't really care. I also asked if they would be so kind as to add more salt to the meat this time, bc the prior cheesesteak was kind of bland. They said they would make a note of it... no noticeable difference, the second cheesesteak was still bland. 

The cheese fries were not plentiful (not like Five Guys) but they did not skimp on the Cheese Whiz! Sadly, the fries were also not crunchy/crispy (even the ones that were not in touch w/ the cheese).

Lastly, they had a problem w/ the ordering system while I was there, and it took at least 30 minutes to get our food. They knew about the problem when I ordered (bc I heard some of the employees in the back asking if ""it worked yet."" But the cashier didn't mention at all that there might be a delay... 

Overall, I wish that I knew how to make the meat in my cheesesteaks get that great texture, but as for the flavor of the meat itself, I prefer the ones I make at home. Might go again (when the cheesesteak craving hits) just in case this particular visit was a bit of a fluke, but it's not exactly cheap either.",2011-12-09 15:50:52
Fm-A5Q1Q9gfSa1p44p4ixA,XBZwZslf14yvV-0_5GSyCg,eLil1U9XjHc_V57EYu-AFw,1,1,0,0,"I'm about 10 months late writing my review so clearly I'm pissed if I come back to it this far down the road. I had initially written a review bashing Cherry Hill triplex, and I still stand by that. However, at the time u praised Turnersville Kia and that I must retract. I didn't think things could get worse after Cherry hill triplex, and then I met the men of Turnersville Kia. I went there back in August of 2015 looking for a car. I had just totaled mine in an accident. After explaining the shafting I got from triplex I was assured I would be treated with the utmost of respect here. Angelo was my salesman. Before I continue ripping this dealership to shreds, let me say that Angelo was probably the most humble man I have ever met. You're so used to car salesmen being these uneducated pricks who walk around with the attitude of 40 year old frat boys, but not Angelo. His consideration for his customers finances and personal trials set him aside from anyone I had ever done business with. It explains why a week after I was screwed over, I was informed he had left the dealership. But I digress, at the time I was 22 years old, a student, and my credit wasn't the greatest. We were introduced to a man in finance named Chris Bobie, I will never forget this mans name. After he worked some numbers he got me approved for a 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer. I was in heaven. 22 with a souped up lancer? Yes please! After test driving and sighing some papers I drove the lot with my new dope ride. (It was at this time that I wrote the review for the triplex) 

The week went by and I was waiting on a call from the lenders because that is general practice. After about 10 days I received one. She went down the list of everything and except for the mileage everything she stated was correct. I ended that call thinking nothing of it. 

Fast forward 2 weeks, I'm at court receiving call after call from Kia. When I returned the call Mark, another man in the finance department answered. He informed me that there was a mileage discrepancy and I was needed at the dealership to sign some updated papers. I then asked how long it would take being as though I had work in an hour. He told me no longer than 10 minutes. What a load of bull.

I arrive at the dealership 20 minutes later and began the waiting process. 15 minutes in the waiting area, another 20 in Chris' office. Finally 35 minutes later Chris walks in and informs me that the deal was no longer good. THEY HAD LIED ON THE APPLICATION TO GET ME APPROVED!! They stated on the application that the car had 20000 miles less than it actually did. I had to unload my things from the car and wait on a ride. I was back to square one. 

Moral to the story: don't deal with this SOBs they're arrogant and dishonest, take your money elsewhere. I ended up getting a newer vehicle from Nissan of Turnersville and 10 months later I still have it.",2016-05-21 00:41:04

When we made the plans we saw on their facebook page that they were running a living social special. It was $20 for $40 worth of food, so we purchased it. They were running an all you can eat crab special and they also had some happy hour app specials. We asked the bartender if we could use the Living Social for the crabs. She told us we could so we ordered them. We ordered a couple appetizers, they were your normal frozen bar food items. Nothing special, just ok. The crabs were horrible. The shells were soft and rubbery almost and they were very bland. When we received the bill we were informed that the happy hour appetizers and the crabs were not covered by the Living Social promotion even though before ordering they said it was ok. We spoke to the manager and she was no help whatsoever. You would think that they would have appreciated the fact that we brought a small group to their establishment, but it didn't matter.

This place has pretty good burgers, with a ton of toppings. The onion rings are the stars of this place, super thin onion with a super crunchy thin exterior. There is a list of so many milkshakes, it would take you a few years of regular visits to try them all. The fries are seasoned and pretty good, unless they over season them, which they've done before. I don't know why they do that, since you can always add more with the shaker of more seasoning on the table.

There are 4 types of dipping sauces and we enjoy all of them except the garden vegetable. What I like about the cheese, is that it isn't a generic cheese, it is slightly different than most cheese dipping sauces, and is pleasant.

Fried egg isn't on their menu as a topping, but it would be nice. I usually fancy the bacon and onion rings as toppings.

I recently moved to Williamstown from Philadelphia. I own a 2012 KIA Optima that I purchased new in Philadelphia. This past Saturday my wife got up early to go grocery shopping. She started the Optima and it stalled on her. I was very worried because the car only has 30000 miles on it. I decided that I should take it into the nearest KIA dealer to get it checked out, this would be Turnersville KIA less than one mile from my home. 

I was able to get the car to stay running after it warmed a little, drove it there and left it with the service department. I was told they could not look at it till Monday. Monday rolled around and 8am I got a call from the lady at the service department (she was very nice). She told me that her mechanic found massive sludge in the engine and that the car would need a whole new engine. She informed me that I needed to provide 5-7 oil change records for the vehicle or pay 4500 for a new engine. She said this was KIA's policy and that her ""manager"" would not accept anything less. 

I informed her that I didn't have 5-7 records that I could prove, I'm cheap and do most changes myself or wherever is cheapest (no I didn't save them) However I had at least 4 records that I could provide from Jiffy lubes and other such places from when I didn't have the time to do myself over the last two years. I was told that this was not enough and they were unable to do anything about it. Basically treating me like I had done something wrong (other then being cheap) to mess up the car. The service manager refused to even speak with me on the phone.  

I decided at that point not having 4500 that I would talk with the dealer I bought the car from (KIA on the Blvd in Philadelphia). The service manager there told me to bring the car in and he would look at it. I picked up the car and drove it the hour to them and left it. I got a call the very next day from them telling me they looked at the car and the engine was clean and 4 service records were more then enough to prove that I was not at fault. The engine did need to be changed and they were taking care of it for me. 

No massive sludge and KIA'S policy is every 7500 miles for oil change. 7500X4=30000. However having actually taking the time to look at the car they could tell right away the rod barrings were bad at 30000 miles. Even if I had never changed the oil this should not have been the case and I'm sure they would have taken care of me with no records. 

I would steer clear of this dealer at all costs, go to KIA on the Blvd in Philadelphia. John the service manager will treat you right if you ever have an issue with your car. Turnersville KIA needs to learn a little customer service. Ohhh and save those records :)

Hope this helps..

My experience at Tony Luke's is not based on the food, the Roast Pork was fine and filling. They accepted my order over the telephone prior to there opening time, but insisted not to arrive before 11am. 11:05 would be better. I thought this was strange , but after seeing their hours posted on the door I understand. I am no genius, but Sunday is game day and an 11 o'clock start  doesn't  make sense, especially with all us Philly Sports fans. The service was quick, the cost was average and the place was clean. A little too clean. After I picked up my order I slipped and fell on my ass and realized the floor was wet. The counter girl and manager (I think) just stood there and if it wasn't  for another customer, I probally would still be on the floor. The manager did ask me if I was ok.

I had been in 4 previous times over the course of two months to test drives cars and make sure I was making the right decision coordinating with sales associates Justin Rivera and Brandon Hutter. On Wednesday my Dad and I went in fully intending to purchase the Kia Sportage with a deal that had been previously discussed FOUR separate times in person and through e-mail with both Justin and Brandon. After sitting for hours, managers came by one by one to explain that all 4 of the previous times I had visited the sales associates made mistakes and didn't fully understand what they had been offering to me, even though I have it in writing and several e-mails, and further explained I wasn't even in the ball park range of what we had discussed. Managers discrediting their own employees then asking for thousands more than the deal that was discussed on 4/25 just two days before I came to visit. They pulled the deal off the table. Called Kia Motors Inc and explained the situation and they told us to ground the Kia Forte (the car I was trading in) at the dealership. When we turned over the keys, Kia Turnersville refused to take the car back. They did NOTHING to help us the minute we walked in the door. I wanted to buy a car. I will never go back to Kia Turnersville thanks to managers Mark and Vince who clearly have a play that they rehearse when customers walk in.

We left and drove up the street and purchased a 2016 Honda which is already way better than my Kia. Don't ever go here. Absolutely appalled.

I had recieved a Groupon as a gift and was excited to use it. We came in during happy hour (about 6) and sat at the bar. The place was pretty empty except for a few other people. The happy hour drink specials can't be beat (we each had 4 drinks for $21 total)

The first bartender was very friendly and accommodating.  We order the sampler and calamari. Calamari was cooked perfectly but you could tell the rings and the legs came from different places. They had different batters and the rings looked uniform so I'm assuming they were frozen but tasty none the less. They come with a white basil dip that we loved. The sampler was ok but small for $11. The mozzarella stick* was cold and they only give you one eggroll.

A second bartender came in, an older women with dark hair and she had a 'I'm better then you' attitude. From where we were sitting we could hear her entire conversation with another employee and she said ""f*cking"" so loud I actually stopped eating to look up. It was very unprofessional for a place that claims to be family oriented. As I did the first bartender I told the second we were using a Groupon for our food. I continued and asked for an order of hot wings. She looked at me like I was stupid and said the wings were .25 on Mondays. I told her I simply wanted an order of wings knowing the Groupon didnt work with specials. Again she repeated herself and looked at me like I didn't understand her. I repeated myself and asked simply for an order of hot wings and a chicken quesadilla. After that that atmosphere waa awkward and I wanted to leave. I asked her to close out my tab and she asked if I wanted the alcohol on a seperate check. Groupons usually do not cover alcohol so I said of course and she responded by saying 'yea alcohol can't be bought with those'. Ok so then why would you bother asking? She was one of the rudest bartenders I had ever seen. We paid the bill and took the food to go. We won't be dining inside ever again and if we do return it would only be for the tiki bar.

We live very close and we really want to love this place because it has four different venues not counting the banquet rooms. 1) Outside Tiki bar (Deck). 2) A big inside bar. 3) An outside patio with seating for dinner. 4) An inside white tablecloth area for dinner. The Tiki bar is fun with live music and fresh air but it redefines the word packed. I mean PACKED. It's usually standing room only unless you get really lucky and then you could easily wait 10+ minutes to get any service when you need to place a drink or food order. We tried the deck on a Tuesday for a quick bar food dinner with a couple of drinks. 90 minutes later still no food and we had to beg for our second round of drinks. Also keep in mind that you are lakeside and will be eaten alive by mosquitoes and bugs so wear some bug repellent. We tried the same thing at the inside bar on a Thursday night. It was not very busy and the bartender was friendly but the drinks were not cold. The bar food was good but the bar was all locals and regulars that kept yelling at each other from across the bar. One gal was so drunk she fell off the bar stool once and knocked it over a little later. We felt like unwelcome outsiders. Fast forward to last Friday. We decided to give dinner in the dining room a try. We arrived to an insane amount of cars in the parking lot (Tiki Bar Customers) and had to park in the dirt overflow parking area. Once inside we were greeting by a friendly older gentleman that sat us immediately. A waiter (who offered no name) took our drink order (Two martinis) and disappeared for over 10 minutes. When he finally arrived with our drinks he said there was a delay because they ran out of martini glasses. I thought to myself ""Fair enough, but if you were waiting all this time for martini glasses why is my martini being served in a rocks glass?"" Moving on. My martini was supposed to be an orange cream cycle (Don't judge me, it sounded refreshing at the time) but what I received was a rocks glass of pure white milk with gin or vodka in it, and it was not cold. I switched to beer. We ordered 1 appetizer to share. The stuffed mushroom. It was delicious. My wife ordered the sea-bass and I ordered penne-alfredo. After our appetizer arrived we did not see our waiter again for a little over 20 minutes. We feared our salads were forgotten and our entrees would be out any minute so we asked a busboy to go and find our waiter. Once he was found we asked about our salads and he told us that he was just working on them but was pulled away when we asked for him. ""Really? The waiter is in the kitchen for 20 minutes making two house salads?"" So the salads finally arrive. Both salads are room temperature with about a teaspoon of dressing in the center of the plate. We finished the salads and waited for our dinner. During this time we noticed the couple across from us that were seated a few minutes after us had eaten their appetizers, salads and finished their dinner and were getting aggravated that their waiter was missing (Different waiter than ours). The wife flagged down the busboy and he found their waiter. They received their check, paid and left. Us? We are still waiting for our dinner to arrive. Earlier during the salad story my wife asked for a glass of Pino Grigio to have with dinner and she received a glass of Riesling instead. Once dinner arrived it was delicious. I have to say the food has always been very good each time we visit. At about the 3/4 point of eating our dinner with forks of food in both of our hands and a conversation going a new busboy walks up to our table and interrupts our conversation by blurting out ""Can I take your plates? Do you need anything wrapped?"" WTF? I explained to him with my fork of pasta in my hand that we are still eating our dinner. He said OK and left. When we were actually done with dinner our waiter stopped by. My wife was still working on her glass of Riesling so I asked for a beer. 20 minutes later she is done with her wine and went and came back from the bathroom and I am still waiting for that beer. We wait another 5 minutes then grabbed that poor busboy and sent him hunting for our waiter yet again. The waiter arrives and with some frustration in his voice tells me he was just about to bring me the beer I asked for but the busboy made him come to our table instead. I just laughed and said at this point we just need the bill. We paid and left.

Today, he texted to say both lattes came with soy. Only mine was supposed to. He brought that to their attention and they replaced it. Sadly, he only took a sip when he got home. ""Taste this.""

The reason I was considering a 3 star rating was because of the numerous times they've forgotten something in my order (both drive thru, and dine in).  Whether it was giving me a small iced green tea when I ordered a large or forgetting my bread bowl and not finding out until I arrived at home, there always seems to be some sort of ""glitch"" in the order.  

Other than that, their service is exceptional.  Anytime I do have a problem with my order (i.e. the bread bowl missing) I call and they apologize sincerely and put my name on a list for me to receive what was missing the next time I return.  I never really get too upset when an eatery misses something from my order if they are sincere about the mishap.  They have a great selection of items, especially for breakfast.  My favorites are the everything and cinnamon bagels, iced lattes, crumb cake (for $15 you can buy a whole one which is great to bring to a gathering for dessert), chocolate duet cookie, iced green tea, french onion soup, chicken cobb avocado salad, and asiago steak sandwich.  My daughter's favorite is the kids buttered ribbon noodle which she devours.  I find it overpriced at $4.49 for a small helping of buttered pasta, but my kid is a picky eater so I often overlook it.

I'm sure in time, since the location is fairly new(ish) to the area, they'll work out their ordering issues.  In the meantime, I'll continue to give this location a chance to prove itself of my 4 star rating!",2015-04-22 02:51:59

When this one opened, I was pumped to have a drive-thru Starbucks, where I could roll out of bed, hop in my car, and buzz on through without having to look even the slightest bit presentable. But I've ran into some snags here..

Firstly, some of the employees are AWESOME, and I absolutely LOVE them! Personable, amazing baristas, who nail my drink order every time! They are what keeps me coming back!

Now, for the rest of the employees: unenthused, nervous, and unsure of their barista-required-knowledge. Multiple times my usual ICED Americano, with hazelnut, soy milk, and extra, extra, extra, extra caramel drizzle has popped out of the drive-thru window either hot, soy-milk-free, or lacking the extra (...extra, extra, extra) caramel drizzle. I'm usually flexible on the extra x4 caramel drizzle, and I understand that not every barista wants to dump the whole bottle in my drink, but throw me a bone here guys! Or some caramel drizzle... Throw me some caramel drizzle, please. I've also had sandwiches burnt or undercooked by the same employees. 

On the days I'm not rolling through the drive-thru fresh out of bed, I like to actually go inside this Starbucks. It's pretty big, with ample seating, super clean bathrooms, and a nifty private ""conference"" room in the back - how cool? Definitely way better for sitting down in and enjoying your coffee, or meeting up with friends. They also have a few outdoor tables, and a picnic bench across from the drive-thru window on the side. 

Lastly, the drive-thru placement here it's a little strange. Make sure you drive passed the front of the store,and make your SECOND right into the drive-thru. Despite the sign pointing towards the drive-thru entrance, I've still witnessed multiple people try to turn into the exit *face palm* c'mon guys.. 

Either way, I will continue to return to this Starbucks for (sometimes) excellent service, (usually) correctly made drinks, it's convenient drive-thru, and ample indoor and outdoor seating.",2014-09-02 14:52:48

On the Japanese/hibachi side, the food is always full of flavor and delicious!  We always have left-overs which I completely look forward to the next day.

Today I ordered a rapid pick up order that had the butternut ravioli and soup with baguette as the side choice.  I wasn't given the bread, and the pasta container was jammed into a bag that was too small causing the lid to be open.  Needless to say, by the time I got to the office to enjoy my lunch it was cold.  The pasta was dry and didn't seem to have any sauce, which I thought was strange because a co-worker raved about how delicious the same pasta dish was when she had it last week.  With Panera's prices a bit on the high side, the employees should be cautious to ensure the orders are correct.  Especially with a drive-thru or rapid pick up order when you typically don't realize the error until you've already driven off an arrived at your destination.
I voiced my concerns about this location via the Panera website.  I received a response from corporate within a day.  They advised me that management at this location was made aware of the issue and would be in touch with me very soon.

I was there for Happy Hour which later transitioned to a bar/club scene with very young chicks, DJ and the typical nonsense. 

Villari's was nicely decorated for the Holiday's and has a nice open dining room bar area. Three stars for my experience due to the fact that 1. bartender made one of the worst kamikaze shots I've ever had 2. bartender wasn't too attentive as I had to wave her down despite the bar being nearly empty 3. the food orders go on a separate bill meaning that if you are sitting at the bar and order food you must pay the waitress and the bill will be separate from the bar tab. OK, whatever, administratively that makes no sense.  Regarding the food, the happy hour specials are killer, very inexpensive and good portions. Drink specials - $4 for a martini?!?! OK they were weak but $4 is $4. 

I think Villari's is definitely a good destination for a lot of people that live a little deeper in Southern NJ. I can see the place being very crowded on the patio in the summer. Outside of  a few little annoyances (and I will strike a place on the details), it's a fine place to stop in for happy hour, dinner or (gasp) even dancing to disco. Yes, disco.",2011-12-17 13:58:13

Ordering - waited in line for 1 minute. Food came within 5 mins (4 sandwiches ordered to go). The ordering system is laid-back vs. the Philly location - where you need to be prepared to ordered and order ""appropriately.""

The restaurant was very clean, reminded me of Five Guys. Plenty of seating available, and parking was not an issue.

I ordered a traditional cheesesteak with onions, mushrooms, and cheese whiz. The bread was very fresh & soft. The steak is NOT chopped up, but rather layered in the bun. (I'm a fan of having the meat chopped.) The steak had great flavor. There were times when I order a cheesesteak out, and the meat isn't salted enough, bland tasting. Not this sandwich, it was very good.

Plenty of onions and mushrooms - sauteed very well.

Cheese whiz - great - can't really butcher this up too much......or can you!?

This location does deliver - according to their big sign in the front.

I would definitely come back here and order again, however, I will also try the other locations as well. The pork sandwich was good too.

At this point, it was cold and gross because they brought the same wrap out 3 times. I was very disappointed.",2019-03-30 23:55:18

The folks here bill themselves as no-pressure sales people.  Of all the dealerships we visited that day, they were the most hands-on, in-you-face, buy-now type of dealers.

They did have a bog variety of cars and we test-drove what my wife was interested in.  Fortunately, we were unimpressed with it so we didn't buy.  My wife had given them her contact info, however.  They call even though we told them we purchased a car.

Not even enough to come close to covering the burger (nice premium topping). They also overcooked the burger.

* I'd say two stars for food, zero and possibly negative stars for service*

On a whim today, instead of going to our usual Japanese spot (Tokyo Tasty!) me & my bf decided on S&P thinking we'd get some decent priced sushi since it was lunch hours. WRONG. all sushi was still full price but we went ahead and ordered anyway. I got a chicken teriyaki bento box and he got three rolls. 

Let me start by saying the service was terrible. I'm talking 20 minutes just to get my miso soup terrible. We were the only ones in the restaurant, btw. Then out came my bf's sushi....he liked it. No complaints there. As soon as the waitress sat my bento box on the table I kind of scratched my head. The salad came with no ginger dressing, and the chicken fried rice I was forced into getting ( I wanted vegetable fried, but she insisted they don't have it? weird) didn't even have any chicken! Then I took one look at the actual teriyaki and laughed...I will include a picture. Did they seriously put seven cubes of chicken in my box and expect me to be satisfied? What a joke! 

So I tell my waitress to send my food back (no way in hell am I paying 12 bucks for that!) and she says she has to ask her boss? strike one. Then her boss, who is apparently the S of S&P, comes over and literally starts shouting at me. strike two, three, and four. ""Why would you come to a restaurant and pick something you don't like? You still have to pay for this even if I throw it away! I've never had complaints before, you must be lying!"". She seriously said that to me!! 

I kept my cool and explained that she, in fact, wasn't going to make me pay for anything. My bf boxed up his sushi and we got out of there as fast as we could. It's a shame that she would ever berate and shout at a customer like that, she really left a terrible taste in my mouth.

They also have the Starbucks Clover machine there which lets you get really great coffee instead of typical drip coffee. I personally am a bigger tea person so I don't try the Clover machine a lot, but I know a lot of people who rave about it.

Most of all, I find the employees at this Starbucks to be super nice. They're all really friendly and they do really care about making sure your drink is just right. And when you're paying a premium price for a drink, service is a big deal.

We originally wanted to eat somewhere else but the wait was too long so I called beforehand to this place. The guy seemed a little taken back that I asked for a table on such short notice but they said it went through. We arrived and the staff was polite and cordial. The servers were very nice and the food was good! I had the chicken parm, most of my family had ribs, and my mom had a seafood plate. We were having a lovely time and it was nice because my aunt and uncle were moving away soon so it was nice to sit and talk. 

So since we were having a nice time, how could a nice place with nice food be getting bad reviews? Well probably over little things like how cramped it felt to be in the top floor, I was up against the wall and hardly had any arm space! After a good dinner, I was really thinking of leaving a good review here. However, the host came up and asked who made the reservation and I raised my hand. He asked how everything was and we gave an honest answer that it was good! Then he goes on and says that since he did us a favor, we can do him a favor and give him our table because he really needed the table. Well fortunately for him, we were already on our way out but it did leave a bitter taste and awkward end to the night. I understand he probably did not mean anything offensive but it rubbed me and my family off the wrong way and left a bad taste to the end of what seemed like a nice dinner. It came off as impolite in our opinion. 

I want to be fair in my review. Service was excellent and the servers were very polite and friendly. My brother has autism and a server was very friendly toward him.

I was looking forward to trying this place for quite a while. My husband and I went to the bat first for a cocktail. At 7 p.m. on a Friday night it was already loud. I can't even imagine how loud it was going to get when the band started. 

We grabbed our drinks and high tailed it to the dining room. Unfortunately, that wasn't much quieter. There was a surprising amount of screaming and yelling and overall ill behaved children for what I had hoped to be a nice dinner. I had hoped that a lakeside ""finer"" dining establishment would have attracted less toddlers. 

The dining room itself was very nice but some tables had tablecloths and others did not. Ours did not. I don't know if that is normal protocol but it seemed quite odd. We were seated upstairs in the loft. Our table wss by the window tasty overlooked the lake. It was rather nice. The outdoor patio looked like it would be fantastic in the nicer weather.  

Our waiter had zero personality. And it was so loud in the dining room with all of the screaming toddlers that we could barely hear the specials. I had the filet oscar and my husband had the seafood combination. My filet was perfectly cooked. It was to be in a Marsala wine sauce with lump crab meat and shrimp. I did not taste any marsala and the sauce was very bland. There was little to no dreading or flavor.  The masked potatoes were dry and bland. And the asparagus was overcooked. My husband's seafood combination was no better. The clans casino were mushy filler. The seafood overall was bland and flavorless and the lobster was just blah. Im pretty sure that it was langostinos and not fresh lobster.   We asked to have our leftovers wreaked and our waiter brought out containers for us to wrap it ourselves like we were at Applebee's. We even had to ask him to bring us a bag reverb though other tables had bags. Anyway, we asked for a dessert menu and Easter than bringing us a menu, our waiter quickly ran down a list of what they had.  I thought that was odd since the have specific dessert menus. Other tables were offered a dessert menu. Not us. And since it was difficult to hear over the toddlers we had to just decide based on what we could hear. We chose the Creme Brulee. It looked nice. I can't say that it was have torched. The sugar wasn't really melted into that crackled sugar. And the custard outsell was flavorless. I didn't even knew that was possible.  I had only two bites and that wss enough. It was the final nail in the coffin for our bland and boring dinner.   We won't be rushing back.",2016-03-26 03:03:06

She took the phone call, and proceeded to take two more phone calls before even looking my way. After 10 minutes she finally addressed me, but with an eyeroll. I simply asked if any slices were available, she glanced behind her and said ""no."" So I asked if she knew when a pie would be out (because it's lunchtime- 12:30 I assumed a pie for slices was firing up) and instead of asking or requesting a pie for slices she says to me ""I honestly have no idea."" .... so I left feeling very confused as to what I even bothered going there for.

The next day, I called Bob to let him know that we wanted the Sportage, and to agree on a purchase price. We made arrangements to come in and finalize the deal.

We went back to Kia of Turnersville at our agreed upon time, and left in our new Sportage two-and-a-half hours later. This has to be a record! Everything done by Bob Peters and Kia of Turnersville was handled professionally, and we left very happy.

When we brought this matter up to our waitress, her response was ""you should have specified what size dinner you wanted"".  NOWHERE on that menu did it say that the Chicken Parm dinner came in two sizes and it certainly did not have two different prices reflecting two various options. She then proceeded to angrily storm off to ""talk to the manager"".  When she returned, she said that the manager took $5 off. She did not try to hear us out and didn't care to listen as she just walked away. NOT $5 off BOTH meals...just $5 off the entire check which was over $70, (drinks, dinner and dessert, times 2). If I'm not mistaken....the small plate was $13 and we were charged $20 each meal. That's a difference of $14.  The best Villari's could do was $5 off.

I just sat down out at the tiki bar area with my aunt for a drink after flying in this morning to visit my family for Memorial Day weekend. The waitress Isabella asked for my license. I gave my license to our server when she asks to check my ID. She asks for another form. I state that that's my drivers license that's all I have. She proceeds to ask for a credit card because she states she sees fakes everyday. I show her my card. She takes my license walks away. I see her get on her phone then go to the bar. She finally comes back and says I'm good. I asked her what she was doing and why. She states that she googled a GA license then went to my Facebook. I'm from this area. I'm 28, and this whole ordeal was too much. Please teach your servers to recognize out of state license and how to better handle these situations. I felt more harassed than anything. I'm going to make sure my Facebook privacy setting are set up to make sure I'm not stalked by servers who look me up. My aunt is older so I kept my cool but I won't be patronizing this business again and neither will my family. I get people use fakes but the markings on my license aren't easily duplicated and considering I'm here with a mature woman the chances of me using a fake to take my older aunt out don't make sense. Oh and she brought my drink out in a glass with old food stuck to it.

I did enjoy the happy hour appetizers, and I can see she tried to make up for the rough start hence the second star. I ordered the hummus plate and the calamari. Both were well done. The hummus had a different but pleasant texture that suggested it was homemade. However I would've preferred more pita slices or cucumbers for the large portion.",2018-05-24 21:45:12

My boyfriend and I were invited here for a party. We had to share a table with other people we did not know from the same party of guests and were therefore told we would be charged gratuity for the entire table, although it was only the two of us. I am a former server, I have no problem with paying 20% gratuity+, however once you hear about my meal I'm sure you'll be as furious and frustrated as we were.

Our waitress couldn't of cared less about toning down her attitude throughout the night, as she knew our table was large enough for gratuity. Another women at our table ended up accidentally receiving my meal which was the Chicken Francaise ($23) and began to cut into the meat/ started to eat the pasta. Upon explaining to our server that this woman (who happens to be a stranger that I don't know), had accidentally received my meal and had started to eat it, the server gave us an eye roll, did not apologize, and then took the meal back into the kitchen to 'supposedly' ""make me a new dish"". Only two minutes later she comes back with a ""new dish"" that looks eerily similar to the original half eaten dish that she took away. One of the pieces of chicken on my ""new"" dish still even had cut marks in it from this stranger's knife. Absolutely Atrocious! If I am going to spend $90 at any establishment or even $10, I expect to be given a new meal when mine is accidentally given to the wrong person and partially eaten. Disgusting!

Furthermore, instead of making me a new dish, the chicken must have been thrown into the microwave in order to heat it back up because it tasted so rubbery and dry. The soggy wet texture on the outside of the chicken from all the sauce they had put on it could not save this terrible tasting meal and mind you, I am not a picky eater. Despite the inexcusable problem with my own meal, my boyfriend's Louisiana New York Strip ($34) was COLD and not tasty either! Both of us barely ate our meals and then proceeded to pay an exorbitant price for absolute crap. My meal in particular tasted really terrible. It is mind blowing to me why anyone would want to eat at this establishment.

You can go to hundreds of other restaurants in the South Jersey area for similar pricing and get delicious food and amazing high-end service! On top of all of this, we ended up having to tip this server 20% gratuity who didn't even make me a new meal and was rude/ couldn't care less about her job. I was never even made aware of her name- but based off of her age, it would seem that she has been working in the industry long enough to understand how to give good customer service. I highly recommend going anywhere else for edible food so you don't make the same mistake that we did and have to pay that kind of price for inedible crap.

It came it a plastic Chinese takeout container. It didn't even come with chips, but pita chips. As i was very underwhelmed picking up my pita chip, i go to scoop up some guacamole, when i notice how there were ice chips in it. The guacamole is FROZEN!! It's like Mexican water ice. They must pre freeze it and take it out the day of. I literally felt like i was eating shaved ice. It's a shame because this outdoor area is so nice that it is just a waste of space due to the piss poor service. And just FWI as i write this i am now approaching 2 hours and 20 min.

She didn't hurt me, but I have never been treated like that.

After returning home and washing out the gel, the haircut was crooked. Needless to say, I also have hair that is too short and will likely take 3 months again to regrow.

I explained that I was ready to buy the car as long as they came back to me with a good deal. The sales manager knowing I drove from out of state and preferring the vehicle in his lot came back to me with an offer 2-3k over every other first offer I have received for the same vehicle minus one 300 feature.

I have been trying to find a salon throughout Philly but seeing as though by hair is so basic (slight angle in the front, straight in the back) paying $50+ for a haircut was absurd. Great Clips was having a $9.95 hair sale and I decided ""how bad can it be?""

The girl who cut my hair was very nice, but did spend the majority of the 15 min appointment talking about how they're not afraid to say what they're comfortable cutting - or not. However she cleaned up my split ends evenly and I was so grateful that I didn't just pay $65 for a haircut that I gave her a $10 tip. Also a shampoo is normally an extra $5 - I was willing to pay for it, but she didn't charge me.

Haircuts are normally $14. I'd go back for a trim but not for a new style. I wasn't disappointed at all.",2011-07-28 17:50:46

It still tastes good but if business is slow, the way to get customers back is to give people more for their money not cut back on the product and screw what's left of your loyal customers. My friend got a traditional Italian hoagie and the size was half what you get at Primos. The price was $11.79! Way more than Primos and the meat wasn't as good either.

Consistently a solid, reliable cheesesteak. Fries are crispy, but nothing to really write home about. In general, they have a short menu of items that they do consistently well, which is what I'm looking for. I only get 1 hour for lunch, so if I lose that hour on a poorly prepared meal, that sticks with me.

The people working here are great! After maybe 2 regular visits, these folks will learn your name and try to know your order. It's a little thing, but a big deal. Tony Jr. works here with some regularity and can be an interesting fella to meet.

My only ding on the place is that they always prepare your food to-go, regardless of whether you're eating in or not. As a result, there's a lot of unnecessary wrappers and packaging that's thrown away. I'm an environmentalist at heart, so I'd like to see them try to be a bit more eco-conscious with things.

We actually tried 2 new things tonight bc of another review on yelp that I read....

The Shrimp Meatballs.....OMG!!  That recommendation from another yelp review didn't even do these justice!  I ordered a small order, which, was a decent size!  These Shrimp Meatballs are so moist, sweet and yummy!  I kid you not. We were pleasantly surprised!!

We also ordered a quart of the Beef Fried Rice, which we have never had before.  My hubby & daughter were pleasantly surprised.  Me...it was good but my favorites are still the Pork Fried Rice and the Shrimp Fried Rice. 

I cannot brag enough about the Customized Shrimp with Garlic Sauce. I say customized bc Rather than the normal Chinese veggies that come mixed in, I always ask to substitute them for broccoli, carrots, baby corn & water chestnuts. They are always more than happy to make it the way you want it!

I forgot to mention in my other review that they offer a coupon of Free Grandfather Chicken with an order of $35. It's a FULL SIZE ORDER!!!!  FREE!!!!

The four cheeses are Mozzarella, then a Fontina/Mozzarella blend, Parmesan and what might be odd, Feta.  (I like this in a Greek salad, not on my pizza, but it wasn't overwhelming). There is a garlic sauce on the flatbread crust with the cheeses on top.  If you like ""white"" pizza then you may like this.  Next time I'll try a different one.  It was tasty and the flatbread was crispy on the edges.  More or less a thin crust, if you will.",2021-02-05 22:06:42

Being it was insanely packed with no seating and I'm 8 months pregnant, there was no way we could sit up there. We were bummed but decided that we would just order from the more expensive menu. After we ordered our drinks, a table across from us, got their food order and it was wings...from the bar menu! When I asked the waiter why that table was allowed the menu, not us, he got very flustered and went to ask someone if we could order from that menu as well. Needless to say, he came back and said he was yelled at for asking and that he was not allowed to give us that menu. If it would've been just my husband and I, we would've walked out immediately.

She said we ""intimidated"" her when all we did was walk to her office and ask a question. Then she told my wife my daughter was kicked out because my wife's ""tone"" and that my wife was always upset and ""fiery"" and that it was in the best interest of their school. They also treated families who received state assistance differently. Goddard referred to these families as ""subsidy families"" and they were harassed after the new owners came in.

After that, my daughter came home with her hair broken off and damaged, and the school said they don't know what happened. I do not recommend this RACIST place at all.

This review is only based on the sales department. 

I just bought my second Kia Optima from Turnersville Kia. Both times they gave me the run around and tried to take advantage of me until I thought my head would blow off. I don't remember specific names from my first experience, but I do remember a few from my second. 

I got a call from Louis Medina asking to buy back my old optima, and to get me in a new one at no cost to me. Louis did not show up for the appointment that he set. 

Another dealer took over instead. He wasn't bad, but the sales manager Mike came out and told me about a fantastic deal that sounded too good to be true. He then proceeded to bring out paper work and ask me to sign off on things that were not at all what he originally told me. ""You'll get 15,000 miles a year on this lease deal for this price"" then he'd come back with a sheet listing 10,000 miles and try to charge me more when I demanded the original deal. This went back and forth three times. 

I always feel like I need to triple check everything I'm presented with here because they always have a trick up their sleeves and try to take advantage of customers. 

Once you buy a car, they call you about 20 times over the next year for reasons ranging from repeat calls about service reminders to reminding you it's daylight savings. 

On the flip side, the guy in finance, Mark, who draws up the final contract is great. This was my second time dealing with him, and in my opinion he's the only professional person there. He was respectful and courteous. He called me a few days later to see how I like the car. I told him I forgot my ez pass in my old one and my dealer never got back to me about it. He tracked it down and held it until I could pick it up. 

Overall, aside from Mark in finance, the employees in the sales dept. at Turnersville Kia are untrustworthy and will certainly try to screw you. Out of two cars I bought here, I've had a terrible customer experience both times. I'll do whatever I need to to avoid a third experience.",2015-06-23 21:42:36

The pre-school teachers, Vanessa and Tyasia attempted to cover up the incident. Tyasia then breached my confidentiality as a parent and gave mine and my husband's personal information to her mother, who posted our photos online on Facebook and defamed our character, accusing us of threatening her daughter. Vanessa and Tyasia made several false statements to management about the situation. 

The new owners, Jackie and Mike Salters, were awful to deal with, completely unreasonable and heartless. They sided with the teachers, even when my husband and I both explained that the teachers were being dishonest. Jackie and Mike decided to still employ Tyasia-even after I informed them that Tyasia gave my personal info to a third-party, her mother, who used it to attack me and my family online. These issues raise major concerns about the safety of the children at this school and the parents who entrust their children and personal information with the staff. 

I went through all of this while studying for the bar exam; the owners were well aware of this, but showed no compassion for my family. Jackie kicked my three-year-old out of pre-school, when my daughter was the victim-she was bit in the face by another child and the staff tried to cover it up! Jackie and Mike put us out like garbage on the street and with only a few days notice. I have never been treated so poorly, but worst of all, my innocent baby girl suffered as a result.

I'll probably be banned for saying this, but i'll say it anyway...i think pizza shops in NJ have better cheese steaks than Philly. YUP...you read that right. 

And Nick's Pizza is one of them. The Rustic Cheese Steak is so bomb, so overwhelmingly delicious! I've had it once, and i'm a big fan of it. Even craving one now that i'm writing a review for it. 

We also ordered some fries and two pies, one plain and one pepperoni. The fries they have are pretty good too. They are the extra crispy type and not overly salty. The pizza i thought was good, but the sauce/cheese combo was slightly salty. The pizza dough was nice and the pizza itself was evenly baked. 

We did pickup, so we had little interaction with customer service. The cashier that took care of us was pleasant.

Till next time, rustic cheese steak!",2015-01-16 16:46:30

When she repeated it to me, I said it again. After 30 mins of standing in there, I made the mistake of rushing out and not trying it before I left. Do you think there was sugar in it when I finally got it home?

It was my first time here, but I had  heard very good things about the restaurant from coworkers and was really looking forward to going.

Villari's has a lot of options on its lunch menu - small plates, pasta, sandwiches, salads, homemade soups, flatbreads,  1/2 lb burgers, an Ahi Tuna Burger, wraps, etc.. They also have a variety of appetizers and wings (traditional and boneless with different wing sauces like Thai Sweet Chili and Garlic Parmesan).

This is what our table ordered and everyone was pleased with their entrée.
- Roast Pork Italiano: Sautéed broccoli rabe and roasted red peppers with sharp provolone on Italian bread (default side is potato chips)
- Hand-Carved Roast Beef: Italian roll with provolone cheese with the $3 fries upgrade.
- Risotto Pescatore: Shrimp, scallops and jumbo lump crab-meat prepared with fresh plum tomatoes marinara or sautéed garlic and olive oil simmered in risotto.

One of the standout things that I want to commend is how welcoming and attentive the people working there were to our group when we were there. The hostess was very friendly and walked us to the dining room and to a table, which had a pretty view of the lake behind the property. Our waitress was on point and offered menu suggestions. PLUS, she overheard that it was my coworker's birthday, so when she brought out our desserts, there was a lit birthday candle on my coworker's cake slice. So thoughtful!

This is my 4th time getting food from Golden Dynasty. Yes, 4th! (Don't judge me during these crazy times )  
Each time I had HOT, FRESH FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!! 
So that you believe I'm not working for this restaurant,  I'll tell you some of the items I have eaten and shared with my family. Okay, no judgement right?...
1st visit Shrimp fried rice and shrimp roll. (I wanted to go easy on the first visit, because if it was nasty, I wouldn't mind too bad if I threw it away) 

DELICIOUS  My shrimp roll was HOT, FRESH and I had regular size shrimps in my roll!! (Not the salad shrimp or the rubbery tasting shrimp!)
Shrimp fried rice had all the veggies and wasn't too salty! 

2nd visit The husband and his ""particular"" tastebuds decided to give them a try with my Shrimp Egg Foo Young and BBQ spare ribs order. He had sweet & sour chicken with pork fried rice. 
Shrimp egg foo young cooked to perfection and the GRAVY WAS SPOT ON!! (If you enjoy egg foo young, you know the importance of the gravy)
Husband said his was good. Nothing else, just good. 
3rd visit Shrimp Egg Foo young, shrimp fried rice, bbq spare ribs, lo mien, and spring rolls. All was great except I didn't get a chance to taste the spring rolls because a couple of my family members got to it before I did. 

4th visit Tonight... Seafood Fried rice, crispy fried wontons, spring rolls and my husband's favorite, sweet and sour chicken. 
Seafood fried rice is delicious and has large pieces of seafood throughout!! Crab, shrimp, scallops and lobster!!! 
 
I hope this was enough for you to decide to go to this restaurant because I know I'll be going  

I didn't give a 5 star because I didn't like my spring rolls on the 4th night. ‍",2020-07-12 00:43:43

Consistently a solid, reliable cheesesteak. Fries are crispy, but nothing to really write home about. In general, they have a short menu of items that they do consistently well, which is what I'm looking for. I only get 1 hour for lunch, so if I lose that hour on a poorly prepared meal, that sticks with me.

The people working here are great! After maybe 2 regular visits, these folks will learn your name and try to know your order. It's a little thing, but a big deal. Tony Jr. works here with some regularity and can be an interesting fella to meet.

For the dads out there, they have unisex bathrooms with a changing table in one, so no troubles if you need to bring the baby with you.

My only ding on the place is that they always prepare your food to-go, regardless of whether you're eating in or not. As a result, there's a lot of unnecessary wrappers and packaging that's thrown away. I'm an environmentalist at heart, so I'd like to see them try to be a bit more eco-conscious with things.

Not a happy staff member in site 
Not one person greeted us. Not even a smile

everything was yucky cold , drinks were filled half way with no ice. (Why no ice )

The desserts were warm and slimmy ( yes slimmy)

So good that even my buddy Big Al's picky ass had to make a confession to me...to fill ya'll in..Al thinks of himself as having a PHD in General Tsos Chicken, he fondly refers to all Chinese food as ""The Discipline"". He once told fellow Grubber contributor Eric that his local Chinese food spot in Michigan was ""Some Bullshit"" right to his face after E asked him (with a smile on his face mind you, that quickly became a frown) how he liked it. So when he confessed to me randomly one day , with a stern defeated look on his face..like it was really weighing on his soul extra deep... ""Lauren yo I have to say it (as he deep sighed) , I randomly was thinking about it and ...Kings is the best.""

I was overjoyed, fireworks went off, Whitney Houston started playing in the background and I felt a special connection.... right at that moment, me and Al became Chinese food Eskimo brothers. I have been through the whole menu, everything is phenomenal...my go to's are the, chicken and broccoli combination, the lo mein, the cheesesteak egg roll, and of course the general tsos chicken. Everything is made fresh, and you can taste the love in every bite..best of all its easy as hell on the pockets.

The area was nice, it was a view of the lake, however there were dead trees and a lot of stagnate water. It took a little while for our waiter (Zach) to come over but when he did he seemed pleasant. We were ready to order everything which we did and I ordered my typical two ice tea drinks because I drink them fast. 

It was a while before we received our salads which looked like they had been premade a while before being served. The bread that was given to us was hard as a rock, in fact so hard I knocked on the table with it. 

We sat there forever!! Waiting for our food, I asked for more ice tea and it still didn't arrive after 5 minutes I went to the bar with our two water glasses and my ice tea. I had the bartender fill them and returned to our table. 

While sitting there we heard another waiter talking to his table and he went over the specials which we were never told. When our food arrived it had a great appearance. I received the crab cakes which were actually very good, there was a lot of meat and little filling and it was prepared well. My husband however received the salmon which he said was just ok. His plate also had vegetables which were over salted and soggy with water. 

After this we asked for our check, which didn't come to the table we had to walk inside and ask for it again. While I used the restroom my husband asked to speak to the manager and after explaining the circumstance to him he just took the waiters name and asked to buy us a drink, once we informed him we didn't drink he just apologized and went out his day.

Unfortunately when the pager went off I didn't have anything I was willing to risk losing so I gathered my belongings and collected my tray only to find I no longer had a table when I returned .

For the past orders my family has been soo disappointed that this last order a few hours ago cannot go unrecognized. 

I used to brag about how I would order Shrimp with Garlic Sauce, yet customize it with my fav veggies of Broccoli, Carrots, Baby Corn & Water Chestnuts instead of what Chinese Veggies they would usually use, plus I Always specified Mild. 

They have NOT been doing what I promised you in my reviews of customization; at least not correctly.   And what I keep saying to my family is why me?  Why my order when I have been praising them?!?!  

Either they have been forgetting things from our order, even though all of you know that I make the person read it back to me. 

Tonight was a breaking point. 

The Shrimp egg rolls were tiny and barely had shrimp.  Hello, shrink egg rolls??


My Shrimp w/Garlic Sauce that I have ALWAYS specified to be made the same forever was NOT for the 3rd time in a row!  They actually made it with NO WATER CHESTNUTS whatsoever!!!  I always order our food with Extra Water Chestnuts in everything, yet they put NONE!  Not even any in the Pork Lo mein which comes with it!!

My hubby's Chicken with Broccoli and my Shrimp w/Garlic Sauce were not only made wrong, but they were soooo Small!!!!

The extra dark Pork Fried Rice was good but no water chestnuts as requested, yet more expensive?!

The portions were so small, yet their prices have inflated and as for water chestnuts....Good Luck!

The Shrimp Meatballs were ok. Not like they were before.

My experience:  Went to Turnersville Kia before I sold off my then-current car, test drove a Stinger. Liked it but wanted to try a few others before I bought.  Settled on Stinger, fun car.

Called for price, and was told I had to come into the dealership in person.  Let them know it wasn't convenient and also I didn't want to take more time off work just to learn the OTD car price, but staff and mgmt there held fast: I have to personally be inside the dealership IRL in order to learn the mystery cost of the vehicle.   The sales mgr told me, in about these exact words, that once I'm committed to absolutely buying that car, only THEN will I get to learn the price, only in person.  No phone, no text, no email, no fax, no telegraph.   I tried, and he held firm to refusing to disclose the secret price.

Found a near-identical Stinger at Burlington Kia, turns out it's a sister dealership with same policy.  No matter how much I cajoled, they refused to tell me the price unless I got my way up to Burl. Co. (even farther away), only to physically step foot in the door to find out the big mystery price.

My resolution:  I buzzed one of their competitors online, who texted me an out the door quote in about 5 minutes.  I wired them some dough, they delivered the car to me with some paperwork the next day.  No muss, no fuss, no haggling.   Really not sure what the big deal is.

Not sure why Turnersville/Burlington Kia are SO dedicated to the antiquated ways of doing business, selling cars 1990's-style, but that was an annoying hassle BEFORE a global pandemic.  Post-COVID, it's ridiculous.   My guess is that they have an owner who misses the good ol' days of making customers sweat it out all afternoon at a sales desk while they put the screws to 'em, tacking on extra charges for things like Trucoat sealant that nobody ever asks for. [Reference from ""Fargo.""  You're welcome.]

These guys' competitors must LOVE how behind the times these guys are.  I get that they're terrified of those scary ""savvy internet customers,"" but forcing us directly into the arms of other dealerships doesn't seem like good business either.

I pull up DoorDash to process it as a ""reorder at no charge"" while we're on the phone with the manager who's arguing that the order was never closed out or picked up. We're trying to explain to them that we know the pizzas are still there, we know that much. But if we're replacing the order, by the time another driver comes and gets it and drops it off those pizzas will no longer be fresh if they've already been sitting there at least 20 minutes. We spent $80 (yes our total through DoorDash) and he continued to yell about how it's only $65 to them. Okay? That had nothing to do with the situation at hand. We understand that the original error was not nicks fault, but the absolute disrespect that both the original employee (who obviously can get away with it if management is the same) and the manager completely disrespected us when all we wanted to do was make sure that we were going about it the correct way and we're going to be delivered fresh pizzas. We'll definitely never order from here again",2021-07-26 00:43:55

I've personally never had a bad experience with this place. In times like this with the quarantine going on it really does make it difficult to find certain places that are still open as well as still maintain the level of quality they normally would without the pandemic happening. But King's has both of those avenues covered. I've realized that not too many Chinese Restaurants (at least in the suburbs) are open & open consistently thru this quarantine but so far King's has been. I personally live about 20-25mins away from where King's is located & I have a Chinese restaurant around the corner from my house that also has stayed open yet I still make the trip down to King's when I want something BETTER than just average. The only problem I do have is that the wait time has been longer. But that is because whenever I show up to pick up my order there are usually 15 orders ahead of me because just like myself other people know that if you want some delicious Chinese food, then King's Wok is where you need to be. So that's my opinion. Even though I'm apart of a food blog/podcast Just Grubbin' I personally never write reviews on places especially on YELP. But the level of service and taste that I get at King's Wok I had to break my silence. King's Wok gets two thumbs() up in Big Al's Book.",2020-05-10 23:21:31

They convert the outside into a tiki bar type area, and also do weddings and banquets at this location.

The menu is fairly extensive and has a lot of fairly traditional American and Italian fair including pasta, sandwiches, and other hot platters.

The service was very good, and we had no complaints. Overall this is a fairly sizable location, and it appears to be very popular with the locals, especially for the outdoor ambiance. I would highly recommend a visit on an evening where you can sit outside!",2019-07-07 01:02:25

She was very unhappy and cried every morning before the inevitable drop off. When we picked her up that afternoon, we could tell she had cried the whole day. After a few days we couldn't take it any longer. The first day we picked her up from Goddard, it was like night and day. We weren't being overbearing parents, Goddard is just that much better than the competition. Don't wait it out like we did.",2018-11-07 01:05:51
