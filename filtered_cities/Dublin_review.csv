Our favorite dish is the chicken parmigiana, which is unbelievably delicious.  The portions are plentiful for the price, you will almost certainly get two meals out of it.  The vodka sauce is excellent and matched by their red sauce.  Their pasta is always perfect.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention the freshly baked rolls, which really stand out on their own (we must ALWAYS bring a bag home to have with the leftovers), and bruschetta which whets the appetite before every dinner.

Every meal here is exceptional. The servers are great. Go here if you are hungry for Italian and you will never be disappointed.",2011-02-13 16:21:43

My personal favorite is their Cubana sauce over penne. Their Vodka sauce is epic and the Cubana tastes like the base is vodka and has hot peppers and grilled possibly? prosciutto make it sooooo spicy good! Plus their fresh baked rolls to dip push this place to a six star place.
Gets very crowded but worth to eat in since they start you out with bruschetta that is wonderful which you won't get with take-out.",2011-02-15 19:27:15

It is obvious that this place is a huge favorite with locals. After sitting down for a meal with my family I can understand why. The food is akin to home cooking Italian and everything tastes fresh. The pastas are actually handmade and both the gnocchi and the ravioli are both lite and delicious. Nothing here has the heavy feeling of many other Italian restaurants. The chicken parm is crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.

When I say that the portions are enormous, it is not an exaggeration. I had food for breakfast lunch and dinner. The prices are all very reasonable.

Judging by how busy this place is night after night I am confident in my glowing assessment. Being fairly critical, I am really impressed by this little place. You wouldn't think much from looking at the outside, but don't let that stop you. this place is legit!",2010-01-13 17:01:10

It's not fancy - you can tell it's a family business. There can be a bit of a wait to get a seat, although we go later at night to avoid lines. 

The food is phenomenal. When you first sit down, you get bruschetta, followed by delicious hot rolls and butter, then salad and then your meal. You will not leave hungry. You can also order something that's not even on the menu - my dad and sister always order a certain seafood dish that they love and it's only a special every now and then. I always order Penne with Pink Vodka sauce. It's a huge portion too, so I always get to have half of it for lunch the next day. Prices are definitely reasonable, too. It's BYOB as well.

We split a personal pizza which was excellent and before anything they bring you out bruschetta. Then after they bring out their rolls which are amazing because they are homemade. I decided to go with the Chicken Parm because it's one of my go to Italian foods that I have to try every new Italian place I eat at...it was probably one of the best I've ever eaten. The vodka sauce is literally the best...take my word for it along with a bunch of other reviews on here and get it on whatever you decide to order.

The soup was the only saving grace. It was homemade and it was very tasty. The pasta was not home made, yet it was cooked European al dente. You can NOT cook frozen pasta in that way. There was no salmon on the menu and when I asked if they got a new chef, I was told ""the chef is the same chef and the menu is the same."" So Karen F. you obviously were mistaken when you said you had salmon - per the girls at the register.

And I do not care to be bossed around by the waitstaff. What is with ignorant, lazy waitresses who refuse to give customers a new fork and tell the customers to ""KEEP YOUR FORK."" Just get me a new fork!

And as a last insult, the words ""thank you"" were never uttered to us!

I easily made 3 meals out of that single serving of chicken parm. Service was fine as well. For a small town like Dublin this is a fine place.",2014-01-25 15:34:18

Initially, I went with a group of people and we all enjoyed our meals - chicken parm, spaghetti and meatballs, and other various dishes - all very good. The second time, I ordered margherita pizza to go and it was disappointing; smothered in cheese and less than fresh basil and barely any tomatoes. The third time was even more disappointing. I had the spaghetti and meatballs again, but the meatballs were different this time. They looked and tasted like processed, frozen meatballs. I don't know if they ran out of their homemade ones or changed the recipe since the last time, but they were awful. We asked the waitress if they changed the recipe, but her response was defensive, saying that she had the meatballs earlier and they were fine. She said she'd have to talk to the owner to get our money back, but that wasn't what we were asking. We genuinely just wanted to know why they tasted so differently. Hoping the owner would come out to talk us, we waited a bit, then the waitress came out and said they took the cost of the meatballs off the bill.

Do I dare tell you all how really, really, really great this place is?  It's crowded enough as it is - if I tell you I'll never get a table.

OK, I'll tell you a little bit.
It's a no-decor, little atmosphere place run by a genuinely NICE family (the hostess/daughter is marrying the pizza chef in August 2008 in Brooklyn).  They make their own mozzarella, and bake fresh brick-oven pizza on a thin - but not-too-thin crust.

The shrimp scampi is ENORMOUS - they give you over a dozen shrimp.
It is garlicky & oily - so if you order it light on the garlic 'n oil it's even better (IMHO).

The Veal Parm is a flam-family (that's FLAMILY) staple and my mom & I can easily split it.  (Comes with a side of pasta.)

Fresh (onion-y) bruschetta arrives on the table nearly as soon as you are seated.

Cappucino is light and frothy.  (mmmn, mmmn good.)

A great place for families and kids.

Gone is the buffet-style eatery that was so popular with the mall crowd. But in its place are cloth-covered tables and large window booths that allow for plenty of seating. My wife enjoyed her shrimp with pasta very much (though she wished she had inquired about the possibility of getting a famous ""Cafe Riv Salad"". lol), and my Chicken Parmesan was out of this world. Our meals were served to us by the very friendly and beautiful Ann Marie. During our meal we had a blast reminiscing about our many trips to Cafe Riv, enhanced by some of the wall art and decor the owners had brought with them to their new establishment. After our meal, the chef stopped by, and Louise hung-out at our table sharing some laughs and very fond memories of ""The Riv'"". 

Overall, the place is awesome. Plenty of off-street parking. No booze is served but I believe Louise may have said BYOB is acceptable (But check with her first) Service was top notch.

A small shop with one community table, two deuces, and a tiny display case, there were beautiful pastries, donuts and cakes to see, but their tastiness was very much hit or miss. I was excited to finally visit, and although I was there shortly after noon, there was still ample choices available. I selected a half dozen donuts (old fashioned sour cream, glazed), coffeecake mini, brownie and sugar/cinnamon stick. The ten pieces came to $10 and change. Not unreasonable. 

I was 30 minutes from home, and I drove expectantly delaying gratification until I could brew fresh coffee and relax over my sweet score. Upon opening the taped box I beheld the beauties until deciding which to eat first. The sour cream cake donut with the cracks coated in glaze came first. I bent and broke it in half to better fit into my mouth. 

First bite was nice as the flavor of the icing and texture of the cake unveiled. Immediately thereafter I noticed that the foundational base was not completely fresh, but somewhat dry and becoming stale. Too, the flavor of the glaze was not what I anticipated, but a strange tone of sweetness unlike anything I had tasted. It wasn't bad, but it was less enjoyable than traditional dip. The same was true of the standard glaze siblings. Not completely at their peak, and the same weird flavor. 

On the other hand, both the brownie and coffeecake were very good. The chocolate moist, rich semisweet and nicely chewy. The coffeecake chunky brown sugar, cinnamon and powdered sugar on top of a small rectangular pound cake base. Liked them alot.

What to make of this mixed box? Hard to timestamp a pastry or donut. But, it is necessary to inquire about the age of their wares in order to avoid the suboptimal components. I have never done that, still if aging products are for sale it is necessary to be alert to this and do your due diligence.",2019-10-27 15:44:12

Crust was ok, definitely thicker than I like, not as crisp as I would like, and lacking in the smokiness and char. I will try ordering it extra crisp next time to see if that makes any difference. Agreed with my colleague dining with me, it was more like bread than like pizza. Sauce was good, and they used a good quality mozzarella on the pizza. A bit skimpy on the fish, breaking up two fish over a small eight inch pizza.

My significant other and I went to dinner here on (02.17.2020) around 7pm. We're a younger couple in our mid 20's. To start off we come in right behind another couple and they got a friendly greeting and bruschetta. We got no friendly greeting and asked what we want to drink brought us our drinks, asked if we wanted any appetizers we said no but could we have some bruschetta? She said ""sure"" then took about 10 minutes for her to ask for our order and didn't ask for our order said ""and go"" with her book open and pen ready. At this point all we had was our drinks and rolls and butter. Our salads came out 5 minutes later then 2-3 minutes later OUR BRUSCHETTA CAME OUT. Keep in mind there was only 3 tables in there including ours. Like it's a Monday night not busy.  Eventually our food came out I ordered shrimp Alfredo with penne pasta , the pasta was wayyyy under cooked , shrimp was tough and tasted like rubber. I took maybe 5 bites and didn't touch it , my boyfriend even agreed. He ordered the chicken Marsala and the chicken was tough in the middle and gummy on the outside looked exactly like the Tyson frozen chicken you'd get at a grocery store in the frozen section , pasta was super bland and the sauce itself was watery and soup-like. That's not how chicken Marsala is supposed to be. He took a few bites and immediately ran to the bathroom. The waitress was very disrespectful and gave us one word answers the entire night and we think it was due to us being a younger couple because the two other tables in there were older people and she was very polite and respectful towards them. When we went to pay we were asked how our food was he said interesting and he explained how the chicken was and asked if it was frozen the manager in guessing is who she was said we get chicken twice a week and never frozen. She was nice enough to take his order off the bill and apologized for the food he had received. But overall highly upset we just wanted some nice Italian dinner and this is what we received instead.

Sometimes, the pizza is awesome (and gets complements from out of towners who are with us). Sometimes, it's really very mediocre. Same goes for just about everything else we've ordered. Sometimes a sandwich is made perfectly, sometimes not even close. 

That said, we still usually order a pizza from Daniela's every Friday night. After a long week we just want someone to bring us a pie, and we definitely prefer Daniela's over Dominick's for pizza. At least on Friday, if you don't order before about 5:30 you'll have to wait an hour or so for your order to actually arrive. 

The meat lover's Sicilian pizza is a pretty awesome treat when we are feeling like a good filling slice. That massive pie lasts us at least 2 or 3 meals and is pretty fantastic.

We used to sometimes order sandwiches and other items from Daniela's too, but for times when we want something other than pizza delivered we've mostly switched to Dominick's.",2014-01-16 18:25:39

It is a phenomenal and quick place to grab a meal if you are in the area. Breakfast/brunch always comes out delicious and the best lunch choices are the fish or pulled pork tacos. A huge plus for me is that the owners did everything perfectly when it came to proper COVID restrictions. 10/10!,2021-06-09 15:41:48

First of all, the last call is a direct result of the owner's whim.  It closed at 11 last Saturday.  And too bad if you just put money into the juke box, it is gone.  

The bartender flat out told me that the reason the kitchen has such strange hours is to circumvent any inspection by the health department.  I have have personally seen the oderous cook at the bar, and would tend believe they may not be up to code.  

The beer on tap IS cold, but is also cloudy.  Stopped in for TWO beers with friends after a funeral nearby a few weeks ago and all of us were as sick as dogs later that day.  The beer being the only thing consumed in common that day.  I have heard stories similar to this before, but have always ordered bottles and not experienced it myself.  I will contiue with the bottles!

In short, a place with an owner(to be exact, and owner's son) that could care less.  It is more than obvious that they have already made their money from the place and when it annoys them they close early and walk away.  Dublin is a great town with many cute store and a small town mentality. It is a dream that someone will turn this bar around and again make it a reliable place to have fun.",2012-09-28 00:27:40

1Vub2f16R101_RXiz3fpsg,vUie5j2dKqROjhhWvRIu4Q,3VKYbajPpszKNFv32ey2dA,1,0,0,0,"Came for breakfast with my family today. All seemed fine until I received my omelet. I took one bite and I knew something in it was rotten. I believe it was the tomatoes. I quietly waited for the waitress to come back and let her know that something was spoiled in there and that I'd like to see the menu to order something else. No apology, no ""oh no,"" no nothing, I just got an annoyed look. I thought maybe it was just me, but my husband even looked at and said, ""what's her problem?"" She comes back hands me the menu and then comes back 5 long minutes later to see what I wanted.

Quite honestly, her attitude was so poor and unapologetic, I really didn't want to spend anymore money there, so I politely declined, all to receive more annoyance from her. My husband's chip beef looked grey and was absolutely grotesque, there was no way I was taking another shot on something else form that kitchen. Quite frankly, we should've just left, but my kids meals were half way decent.

My husband took about 2 bites from his meal, was never asked how that was, then we asked for the check. When the waitress comes back she says ""I took 2 coffees off the bill and gave you a discount."" LOL! This is what prompted me to write a review bc it's almost too good not to share. So- I added up the bill; there was no discount. Two coffees were taken off, but the $10 omelet remained, the one that I took ONE bite out of and put the bitten out piece of food back onto the plate. Yes, that one. Never in my 45 years of life has someone on a wait staff ever charged me for something that was bad. This was not something I ate half of and said I didn't care for; I literally spit my bite out because something in it was rotten. When she came back to collect the bill, I said, excuse me, you left the omelet on there. She grabbed the check out of my hand and sighed and walked away, then muttered to her co-workers that there's nothing wrong with it.

So, moral of the story, while at one time the Dam Good Cafe's nomenclature could have perhaps been justified; that was certainly not the case for today. The food wasn't the only thing leaving a bad taste in my mouth. To the young blonde waitress, please take some advice from a person who worked in a restaurant since the age of 12, former restaurant owner, and a person who treats everyone in the industry with compassion, one who understands more than anyone that accidents happen and someone who understands that it's impossible to make sure 100% of the food is good 100% of time, your attitude totally sucks. It is the only reason for this 1 start review. Had you said a simple, ""I'm sorry about that,"" not shown your blatant disdain for my dissatisfaction, and perhaps took my word for my food being rotten, I would've brushed it aside and moved on with my day.

Do you think I deliberately ordered something to take one bite and send it back while my the rest of my family ate (or attempted to eat) their meals? Probably not.

Needless to say, we won't be going back to the cafe, despite the rotten food, the food that wasn't spoiled just wasn't good enough anyhow, but most of all, I don't need to sit down, and pay to get treated like crap, ever.",2021-12-04 20:12:12

- lump crab cake that tasted more like a canned pet food pate with neither lumps nor real crab taste evident
- chicken fajitas which guests found nearly inedible. Funny aside: took these home to put outside for raccoons and possums to enjoy and they also gave them a negative review
- fish tacos ordered by two fish taco aficionados who gave them a big thumbs down for taste and texture of the fish.

Just moved here from CT and was happy to see that there was a local Chinese joint, figuring that there would be enjoyable takeout when my family of six gets the itch for Szechuan or Lo Mein. HOWEVER, if you have the itch, scratch elsewhere!!! The proprietors are unpleasant, the food is tasteless if not weird-tasting (more to follow) and they don't accept credit/debit cards (forcing me to walk across the plaza to the ATM. Hello? Add 3% to your prices and join the 21st century.) We ordered about $50 worth of Beef Lo Mein, Fried rice, ""Spicy"" Garlic beef and a couple General Tso's chicken combos.  The absolute WORST beef lo mein I have ever tasted. It tasted like warmed spaghetti noodles. Great beef lo mein has that awesome smokey grilled flavor. This tasted like wet noodles. Yuck. The fried rice must have been out of a box. It just didn't have that familiar sticky, eggy yummy-ness. The Gen Tsos was passable, but that's because every breaded chicken dish typically tastes the same.  Lastly the ""spicy"" garlic beef was blander than the blandest entre at Cracker Barrel. No heat whatsoever.

The chicken had zero favor. The broccoli was not fresh by any means. As another reviewer said, it must have been frozen and then microwaved, it was mush. Then comes the sauce, or the lack thereof. It was incredibly thin, maybe a light brown? It basically tasted like chicken broth. As this is our favorite Chinese take-out entrée, we were very upset. 

The lo mein was the worst I have ever had. The noodles were overcooked and look/tasted nothing like lo mein. I'm not a food snob, but I've eaten Chinese take-out my entire life and had no idea you could ruin lo mein. Overall, there was zero flavor to this dish - overcooked noodles and pork, that's it.  

Having lived in the area for over 7 years, there are many options within a few miles.

Where to start? 

I have always wanted to get a tattoo. I am an artist and a lover of the arts, so it makes sense,  but I never took the jump until I met Sean Duffy at Phenom-A-Bomb. For two years, I researched different artists and looked all over the country, but I never got the inviting vibe that I was looking for from any of those talented folks I bookmarked. And then the strangest thing happened: I ran into an old elemetary school acquiantance at a bar who had a simply gorgeous art piece on his shoulder. It was creative, colorful, had impressive depth and lighting, the shading was highly skilled, and looked like it was designed FOR the actual body part it was on. I had to know who had done it, and was directed to Sean. 

After checking out all of his work and thinking on it for a couple weeks, I decided to make the leap. Even after setting up my consultation I still felt anxious about the experience, but any fears I had about the experience or the end product diminished in about 30 seconds of meeting him.

Right off the bat, he was well spoken, personable, and extremely friendly. He loved my idea, and was very excited to work with me. During our first consultation, I showed him the design elements I picked out and he was already spitting out dozens of intriguing ideas and details that really blended everything together. I was still slightly neurotic about the final design because I had trouble visualizing what he end product would look like. That brings me to an important point about working with him and any other creative artist: if you really want to make the best of your time and money, you need to give him or her creative license. 

Why? You can go just about anywhere to get your compass star or koi fish (and no disrespect if that's what you want!), but if you want the best looking piece possible, you need to give your artist freedom to do their thing. The drawing process is very organic, and imposing too much control over that process and cramp an artist's style. I'm not telling you to dump your ideas and let people doodle whatever they want into your arm, but you should be prepared to let the tattoo evolve as the process goes on. Some of the ideas you thought would look badass just won't translate over well to the body part. 

So what do you do? Do you find someone who will plop whatever you want wherever you want? In my opinion that is not the point of ""body art."" If the piece does not complement the body and soul of the person wearing it, you just have a symbol embedded on you. Again, fine if that's what you want, but if you're as picky as I am then that's not gonna fly. 

That being said, Mr. Duffy has no ego and will not try to push you in a direction that doesn't work with your own philosophy. He will, however, give you honest feedback and suggestions. And if you don't like his design, he will start from scratch for free, and you aren't getting billed for the hours it takes to do that. It's a pretty damned good deal if you ask me. 

Onto the actual day of the first sitting, which totalled five hours, I don't think the process could have gone any smoother. The studio is bright, beautiful, and clean. He will show you all of his tools and explain how they work if you're curious, even going into the hygenic process that the studio uses to make sure everything is sterilized and clean. He's got a huge cabinet full of blu rays if you want to chill, but I like to yak so we talked the whole time (with It's always sunny providing occasional laughs). 

As for the process itself, if you've had work done before then you probably know what to expect. I can honestly as that through the entire five hours, only a couple moments of actual pain occurred. The rest is pretty reasonable (no worse than sunburn). I only bled from one tricky area that had a lot of detail. One of the biggest skills a tattoo artist needs is a feel for the correct depth of the needle in the skin. Too deep and you hit muscle, too shallow and your ink doesn't fully take. It's a sweet spot, and one you need to reach if you want to keep that color looking bright for years to come. That's something that only experience can teach, and he's been doing this for 15 years now.

The first session was last month, and it's fully healed now, looking as bright and beautiful as it did the day it was done. I get complimented randomly everywhere I go now, and everyone wants to know where it was done. 

I can't wait to go back tomorrow and get back on that chair. 

I will be uploading photos to this review when the half sleeve is finished in November.

A note on the other artists: Tara, his wife, is extremely talented, but I have not had the pleasure of talking to her for more than a couple minutes. All of the artists there are highly skilled and up to snuff. If you don't end up working with Sean (his waiting list is getting longer than a year), you will be in very good hands as",2015-07-24 18:48:29
AK_Ps4-p5cjwKjqC-AwdtA,7Sv-npFRXSTg9nre11-Vxg,pEA1WUzNppq7pTBrVz7GhA,5,3,0,0,"I was raised in Texas ""back when,"" my wife in Kansas, so we take our BBQ seriously. Although things have been improving up here in recent years, basically the old saw has held true: Good barbecue joints in the Northeast are like Elvis sightings: You hear about them, but they never actually materialize.

Across-the-board good BBQ eateries in this area remained in Elvis' domain until the Dancing Pig hoofed into Dublin awhile back. It bills itself as being Texas style, defined as, in order of importance: sausage, beans, brisket and ribs. (Good cornbread helps, too.)

Let's dispense with Dancing Pig's alien offerings: pulled pork, pulled chicken and ham sandwich. The pulled pork is excellent when mated with their eastern North Carolina vinegar sauce, but be careful: A little of this stuff goes a long way. We haven't had the chicken, but their ham sandwich is excellent, especially with optional honey mustard.

As to Lone Star offerings, cowpokes rejoice: Their beans are right up there with the pure-D best my wife and I have had anywhere. The owner could be elected Texas governor if they just gave away enough of this stuff. Supposedly they are derived from a closely held 19th century Montana ranch recipe. Regardless, they beat nearly all of what I've tasted in Texas or elsewhere. Little Blazing Saddles aftermath, either.

Baby back ribs come two ways: Dancing Pig style, and what they call ""Texas style,"" but no burnt ends offered. The difference is in the rub, and Dancing Pig's rub is, to me, better, although my wife likes both versions equally well. In all, these ribs are mighty good and not greasy. They don't really need much or any additional sauce, but their KC type red sauce works with ribs if used sparingly.

Good brisket's not hard to find, but exceptional brisket is as rare as a two-headed armadillo. The best I've had was years back in Texas; it was relatively moist, with the perimeter having crumbled just enough to let the rub penetrate a bit within the meat, not just along the edge.

That was brisket from the hands of angels. For brisket by mortals, Dancing Pig does pretty well. Even without the crumbling edge and as much moisture as is ideal, it fares better than most and mates well with their KC-style sauce -- the accompanying buns are excellent, too.

Sausage? Alas, not offered. They emphasize that they don't freeze anything, ever. They have yet to find a supplier that can provide sausage using their own recipe, yet in small enough batches to be kept fresh without freezing.

They round things out with various baked goods. All we've tried is their cornbread, which is mainstream. Haven't tried their sides and probably never will -- no room left after pigging out on 'cue and beans.

Even without sausage, Dancing Pig is the area's finest -- even better than most in Houston and Kansas City. Pig out, then dance!",2013-09-13 18:16:11

The owners are great and inviting, and we were chatting it up immediately.  We agreed that the yardstick for any new BBQ you try is the ribs, the pulled pork and the baked beans - he said that if a place fails on any of those, then forget it.  I had 2 of the 3, and the Dancing Pig excels.

My son had the pulled pork sandwich which was loaded with the good stuff.  Sauce is served on the side so you can add it as YOU like it.  On the table was a bottle of sweet, Kansas City-style BBQ sauce, and a bottle of the more vinegar-y style sauce.  I got the beef brisket sandwich, and the meat melted in my mouth.  We were offered a free piece of cornbread as new customers, and it was moist and delicious - better than most cake.  

We tried ""Mr. E's Settler Beans"" and ""Mrs. Flynn's Garden Slaw"" as sides.  The beans were a great mix of black beans and your typical navy beans, plus bits of beef throughout - not overly sweet like canned Pork 'N Beans, but with a great flavor.  The slaw was not mayonnaise-based (thankfully! hate it), but more like a light vinaigrette which was great.  We washed down our food with a can of sarsaparilla soda (seriously - when was the last time you had THAT?) and a can of Mountain Dew Throwback (had to).  Our bill was just under $20.00.

We made a big order and found they forgot to put a sandwich in the bag.  We called back and they offered to refund it immediately.  

Hey things happen... and when they do at our work place, we make it right.  Dancing Pig went above and beyond.  It's one thing to have great food, but to care enough to have great service as well, this speaks volumes in today's marketplace.

Through the way they handled their mistake, they have gained our business for life....  I wish more businesses would work this way.  They really care!!

On To the food....  The BBQ sauce is incredible.  We have several BBQ places in Doylestown, but nothing like Dancing Pig.  The minute you hit the dor, it smells so delicious.  Baked beans were great...  Chorizo was spicy!!!  We tried the BBQ Beef Brisket Cheesesteak( off the chain!!) 

I would drive the 15 minutes to get this food and place several other BBQ joints on the way

The cornbread taste like cake... I could eat a whole tray myself...  It did not need any butter...   it was very moist!!!!

The Pit sandwich(which is like rare roast beef) was awesome..  It comes with a horseradish sauce to die for..  My kids loved the Mac 'n Cheese.

We tried Chicken BBQ Cheesesteak, Ribs, Potato Salad, Wings (reg), and Cubano. We wanted to sample as much as possible so we bought enough for lunch and dinner. The potato salad was just good. The potatoes were not overcooked and the taste wasn't sweet (by the way, I prefer German potato salad better than any sweet tasting potato salad). Even so, it was missing something, maybe some garlic and/or bacon. You'll have to judge it for yourself, because others thought the potato salad was great! In any case, don't weigh my opinion about the potato salad too strongly because it isn't the main attraction. Everything else was excellent. My favorites were the wings (regular) and Cubano. The smokiness of the wings will blow you away; never had wings this good. I was also blown away by the Cubano. I don't want to analyze this too much, but it has smokiness and a subtle sweetness in a tasty bun; I wouldn't change a thing about the Cubano. I think this is perhaps the best barbecue place within a 50 mile radius of Dublin, and this includes a couple places in Doylestown. Unfortunately, BBQ places seem to have a hard time in this area. The Pit Stop at Lansdale train station was awesome but doesn't exist anymore. A couple other places near Quakertown recently closed (Chilkoots and Joey's).

And what a pleasant surprise it was it was to find this place in the heart of gorgeous Bucks County Pennsylvania.

Beyond all the beautiful farmland, stone houses and the Delaware River, modern America and a strip mall still intrude upon one's sensibilities.  However, since that strip mall brought us to this place, we were happy. 

It's small but quite pleasant and inviting.  It's run by a husband and wife team and the pair couldn't have been friendlier to us.

We both had the brisket sandwiches (although I skipped the bun.  I just forgot to tell them to just put the brisket on the plate..I hate to waste).  It was mouthwatering, tender and immensely flavorful.
The husband/owner does the cooking and smoking of meat and was more than willing to share his culinary tips with my husband who is the our family's griller and smoker....and always trying to extract others' secrets! 
His wife works the counter and was patient in answering our menu questions and giving us suggestions.

Other menu items include pulled pork, ribs and chicken wings...everything homemade.

There are several side dishes to order which are all a la carte.  They charge extra for cornbread which isn't typical of other barbecue places we've been to however it's worth it as it is amazing.   I sadly often find cornbread very dry.  This was moist and very flavorful.   

You order at the counter here and bus your own table when you're through.  The bathroom was impeccably clean.   
Of note, were the series of black and white photographs hanging on the walls here. They feature scenes of early American settlers.  I'm personally very interested in the period of time when easterners first started ""heading west"" so I enjoyed checking out these old photos.

Once you open the door and smell the inside of the resturant, located in a blink-and-you'll-miss it strip mall along Rt 313 in Dublin, PA, you'll know you're in the right place for good bbq. The place is small, very clean (bathrooms too!) and has a friendly, no-frills atmosphere.

Great selection of meats here, from the standard ribs and brisket to double smoked ham and chorizo. They also have specials on Friday and Saturday from 4:30pm on...on the weekend that we stopped in (2/22/14), the special was a 1/2 pound burger made from their own blend of beef including brisket and chuck. You could even add pork belly! Other specials include a smoked ham steak. Unfortunately we got there about an hour too early. Next time...

As for our lunch, we had a half rack of ribs Dancing-Pig style ($12), a brisket sandwich ($7), a chorizo sandwich (with a house-made garnish made with jalapeno and cilantro, $3), a side of beans and slaw (about $2 each), and the cornbread.

Oh, the cornbread. Spongy, sweet and delicious. Best of all, The Dancing Pig gives first-time customers their cornbread for free!

The ribs were small but delicious; ""Dancing Pig"" style means the house spice rub and a light brushing of sauce. Very flavorful. They also have two kinds of sauce at each table: a vinegar-y Carolina style as well as a thick, sweet bbq sauce. Both are excellent. We were also given some of their ""dust"", which is a spice blend that includes habanero and ghost pepper! I used the tiniest bit on my last rib and got a nice bit of heat. I imagine using alot of this results in exploding heads and profuse sweating. Use caution.

The brisket was great! Somewhat thick slices of brisket (see photo) served on a brioche-style roll. Nice to see a substantial sandwich roll like this instead of the cheaper potato/white burger rolls I've been getting at roadside stands.

I was a big fan of the chorizo sandwich! It's not something I often see at bbq places in the area. It's just one sausage split and served on a simple roll (plus that garnish!), but it's damn good and only $3.

The sides, particularly the cole slaw, were also great. The slaw was really creamy but we couldn't figure out what made it special. Good stuff.

Prices overall were very reasonable; the ribs are the priciest item and they have a great variety of sandwiches (chorizo, cubano, brisket cheesesteak) that range from $3 to $8. 

If you're in this area and want good bbq there isn't really any question that you should go straight to The Dancing Pig. The nice woman who waited on us (the owner's wife, I think) said they've been rated highly amongst local eateries and word-of-mouth has been great, but that in general people in that area don't want bbq.

Very thorough in both the dental and payment information, as well as with my cleaning, X-rays, and exams. I was there for close to 2 hours because I was actively included in seeing the results of my X-rays, learning about my dental issues and how to take care of them, and just talking to the staff (Shelby is the sweetest and most welcoming dental hygienist/maybe person I've come across) and Dr. Cohen (brief, but a very nice experience). For having been put on the back burner for 2 years, my teeth have never looked or felt better. They answered every single one of my questions with care and patience & I am so happy I found them. 

Some nice additional perks: TVs in the rooms (and on the ceiling for when you're lying flat in the chair!), free coffee and water in the waiting room, digitized paperwork (they take you to a separate room to fill it all out on a computer versus flipping through lots of papers), and affordable payment options if you don't have insurance (just ask the front desk!)

If you're hungry and driving through Dublin, or stuck in traffic on the infamous route 313, you owe it to yourself to stop by the Original Domenick's and grab a slice of their famous Trenton style pizza. There really is nothing like it anywhere in the area. 
Everything on the menu is great and freshly made to order. 

Family owned and operated, this old-fashioned style pizza parlor is a true gem tucked away in Dublin. Delivery is available but limited. Definitely worth the trip in my humble opinion.",2019-03-15 15:27:48

We have been coming here for the past 8 years and always had a problem with the lady at the front desk... She was always rude and my parents would always have something to say after they were done speaking to her, but we continued going here because Dr. Knouse is a really nice doctor. They also have a great selection of glasses.
(BACK STORY) Last year my dad was laid off and we were tight on the bills, so we had to change insurance. 
So, this is the day when we stopped coming here and went to another doctor:

We scheduled an appointment as always (6 or 12 months ahead, I don't remember) and when we came here we waited for awhile until the front desk lady came up to us and told us that they didn't know if our insurance covered eye care since we switched. My dad asked them to check... a few minutes later the desk lady doesn't bother to come up to my dad, but to scream across the room asking my dad's social security number or his credit card number. (Like she was expecting my dad to scream his personal information across the room while strangers were in the same room) My dad walks up to her and discreetly gives it to her. She then comes back saying she doesn't know. So, with my dad being a little irritated that the front desk lady couldn't do her job, he wanted all of us to get our eye appointments over with today, so he decided to find out himself. So, he goes behind the back counter on their computer and has to search all of his information to find out whether or not the insurance will cover us.
It takes my dad about 15-20 minutes until he found something that said our insurance wouldn't cover us. Though, while my dad was trying to look on the computer, the desk lady was just standing there talking to another woman that worked there talking about a party they were going to go to. She continued on and on about what she wanted to do with her hair and what she was going to wear... she then laughed as she looked at my dad and said, ""Hey, look we have another employee!"" She just had to make it worse for herself...
Anyway, after my dad found out that our insurance couldn't cover us, my dad didn't really care and just wanted to get the appointments over with. The desk woman then comes in front of us as we are sitting there waiting (and remember that there are some strangers that are sitting there in the waiting room with us) and starts talking about how our insurance wouldn't cover us and how he would have to pay for everything while talking very loudly... She then went on saying she might have to reschedule our appointments since it took so long for us to find out all the information being. (We were there for at least an hour and we arrived there on time) She was being very rude... everyone was staring at us... This woman has no common sense in her head to actually talk to us discreetly about OUR information. (That is what the front desk is for, yet she just thought it was a good idea to tell us all of this in front of everyone in the waiting room... and she didn't even care, she made it seem like it was no big deal, even though we were already there and have been waiting there for awhile)
My dad was fuming by now and he finally got up and said that he wanted them to cancel our appointments for anything in the future and that they no longer will be seeing us anymore. My dad left very angry... Though, they didn't seem to care at all, even though we've been going there for 8 years! 
Since the other review had the same problem, I would really suggest that  that woman would check her attitude or else they are going to be losing a lot of business as they lost ours. We are now no longer going there and now are seeing a doctor that lives only about 3-5 minutes away from us.",2014-09-01 01:09:47

It came to our attention because it looked as though the discounts due us were not being applied at time of billing.  We have Careington discount plan which includes VSP vision benefit.  Each and every year we receive a new card which we always give them and discount information and phone contact numbers are available for staff to check for discounts. We should receive 25% off frames; $40. Lenses; 20% off Lens Enhancements.  
   Apparently, they put Careington card into their system but failed to add discounts listed above. We didn't realize we have to assist office staff, holding their hands, helping them add pertinent information into the system and it is very unfair to us that they refuse to refund overcharges, essentially stealing from us.  We have not been getting discounts that we should have so we were OVERCHARGED in previous years and they refuse to refund overcharges.  Eye doctors here are very good but not office staff because you have to hold their hands, make sure you get discounts. (Never had any trouble like this with dentist bills. Those discounts are automatically applied every time.) PFEC put card in  system but they did not add discount info.

Never was I asked if I was ok seeing an intern (I'm not,  I had some actual questions about a procedure but decide to stay since my rx is expired). Anyway, im eventually seen by the other doctor who was great. But I'm very disappointed by the woman at the front desk. She's never been a joy to deal with, never particularly friendly or anything. But assuming I'm insane because of the office's screw up?  She needs to be reminded that she's in customer service and is a representative of a company. I returned once more due an irritated eye and she was  just as unfriendly. It's unfortunate, but there are lots of great doctors in the area. I was willing drive quite far for my doctor, but not to deal with a disgruntled desk woman. I live within walking distance from an optometrist and will be trying there next time. She could have very easily fixed the original situation with a little communication. But she treated me like an insane person who wandered in off the street. The doctors are truly wonderful.

The staff is nice, most of them are younger teens. 
I thoroughly enjoyed my egg salad that I ordered - so much so that I tried to recreate it with not much success. 
The menu is not extensive and consists mostly of smoothies / bowls and toasts / salad.
I wish they had a few more drink options , maybe some fresh pressed juices, something not as heavy as a smoothie maybe. 
I still very much want to try their coffee. I did try a smoothie and I would not recommend, which is why I'm only giving 4 stars. All of their smoothies sound delicious and I ordered a passion fruit smoothie which consists of:Mango, pineapple, strawberry, banana, passion fruit and all it tasted like was banana including the giant chunk at the bottom of my smoothie. Since I don't like bananas , and it's in all or most of their smoothies, I probably won't order one again for fear that I will again end up with a banana dominant smoothie.

The fish painted on the building are also a nice touch. They have a wide variety of seafood that you can take home or have prepared there. All of the seafood looked extremely fresh. 

It was sort of confusing because they didn't have a menu exactly. We just told the guy working what we wanted and how we wanted it cooked. It took about 45 minutes to prepare everything, which was fine because we had some errands to run in Dublin. He said menus are being printed and should be in soon. We ordered a fried scallop dinner, a fried flounder dinner, a broiled salmon dinner, and two broiled crab cakes. The fried dinners came with fries and coleslaw and the salmon came with a baked potato and broccoli. 

All of it was delicious! The piece of salmon was bigger than I expected and was cooked perfectly. The amount of seasonings was just right. I tried the scallops too. They were very good. The crab cakes were delicious and had a lot of meat. I didn't try the flounder, but I'm sure it is also good. The guy working also gave us a ton of tartar sauce and let us take a lemon from the fridge without charging us, which was nice. 

We were overall very impressed. It was $51.75 for 3 dinner plus the crab cakes. The quality was excellent and the staff was nice. Hopefully the menus are printed soon! I recommend coming here, whether it be for take out or fresh seafood you'd like to cook at home. I can't wait to come back and try the other seafood!

The quality really suffered the past couple of years and I was encouraged to see new management taking over.  Have given them several tries since and my take is that the prices went up and the quality of food and service went down.  Everything is overpriced and have actually been charged for items that the menu said was included (got an ""oops""), like comes with drink but got charged for drink.  The salad bar was subpar and the price is $3 more than it should be.  The soups have ranged from bland to downright awful.  I can get better out of can that's made down by the river (in Camden).

Everyone I know that has been here has said the same thing and says they would not return.  Used to be lots of cars in the parking lot, even at off times, not so much anymore.  There are plenty of places better within a short distance of here.

I expect to see an episode of restaurant:impossible or kitchen nightmares being filmed here or another under new management sign.  New owners (no idea who they are) should walk around and introduce themselves, maybe seek a little feedback.  This could be a gold mine with some changes.  To their credit, breakfast was decent.

Nothing against the old folks but they are the only other customers I have seen here.  That is usually a good indicator of what is going on-just watch one of the shows I mentioned earlier.  My overall impression is this:  new management but same tired food, worse service and all for higher prices.

She showed me her phone and the. Message actually said, wrong username or password. Nothing about it said already had been redeemed.  She told me I had to call groupon and work it out with them.  She charged me full price, which 36 dollars for a pedicure is way too much, no matter the great job the nail tech did.  I dealt with groupon and the last email I got was that the mantra nails would be  calling me to correct this issue within 3 business days and of course  I never  heard from anyone from mantra nail lounge.

RVmsciYTkGdTxF2eJs2qvg,bakuwq8OlXnDmClG4KWoeQ,-KQsS-zouGNa6qczrzO0Ew,3,0,0,0,"Stopped here during a road trip through the area; I love diners and wanted to see what one was like in this part of PA. Our waitress was very friendly and sat us right away at a nice booth. I noticed right away the restaurant was very clean and cozy. I ordered the chicken parm and my mom got a smaller steak with onions and gravy. My meal came with both a salad (from the salad bar), and a soup (also from the salad bar).  The salad bar was convenient and all the food was fresh, I also got a cup of the chicken soup which was good. The food comes out fast and hot which is nice. My chicken parm was decent and had the right amount of cheese and sauce. The menu said it came with a vegetable as a side but the choices were more eclectic, I got Mac and cheese as a side, a weird pair, but that was good.  My mom didn't enjoy her steak (not any fault of the restaurant, it was just that she ordered the wrong thing and wasn't that hungry to begin with). The only area I wasn't satisfied with was the dessert choices, you had the option of going up to the salad bar again and they had some jello and pudding, the waitress also said something about them having pies but I wasn't really in the mood for that (was really hoping for a chocolate ice cream w/ whipped cream, something I thought was standard in diner dessert choices). The other wired thing was when we got the bill the tax wasn't included, she had written on the back, ""plus tax"", but I completely overlooked that since I never really have given much thought to the tax not being there. So when we went up to pay, the cashier said ""you owe me $2"" (the tax). I just thought that was weird, so bring a calculator with you! Overall it was a nice little place but not somewhere I'd go out of my way to return to, if I went back I'd like to try some of their breakfast items.",2015-12-14 04:32:48

Two sandwiches and a breakfast were ordered and everything was absolutely terrible. The chicken gyro wrap was so soggy and moist that you would've thought they ran the whole plate through the dishwasher before serving it. The panini (beef gyro) and the breakfast (eggs, creamed chipped beef and scrapple) had NO spices or seasoning on them whatsoever. The waitress returned to our table at least 3 times (5-7 minutes after our order was initially taken) to take the parts of the order she forgot about. These issues were pointed out to both our waitress and the owner. All we got was a shoulder shrug and an ""I'm sorry"" from the waitress and all the owner was interested in was taking our money even after we told him we would not be returning to his diner.",2017-08-19 14:06:46

The reason for the 2 stars is for my gel manicure. The first time I ever went- I got gel nails w a design on my ring finger. The design was just cute white stripes- thinking this would be painted on but rather they used stickers and then clear gel on top? Needless to say these stickers fell off within two days bc the length was not measured out appropriately to my nail so it got caught on everything. It cost me I believe $35.00. So I returned after 4 days to get it fixed- the man and owner made me feel like this was my fault and rushed me out of there once fixed. At that time I said to myself I wouldn't return.

I heard that Trina was now the full owner - and thought things may have changed-so I gave it another shot. Again pedicure was fine (although my polish did change color? Makes me think if it was diluted?) I did go for a gel manicure w a particular color in mind - beige/cream. Trina did do all my polishing. When she was doing my nails she didn't get the full nail evenly- i did try mentioning this to her politely. However, she did blame it on the color not being easy to paint and also ME not holding my hands straight enough. I desperately wanted her to fix it bc it is soo obvious and also irritating for me to look at! Unfortunately she did not. I even told her ""well I guess I will have to go home and try to fix it"". I got no response. So that stinks.?",2016-08-24 15:30:50

Tucked away in a tiny, off-beat strip mall across from the famous Luberto's, this old-fashioned seafood shop sells wild caught delish catches that make you feel like you're at the shore! Prices rival what you'd paid at the big shopping stores and the catch is fresh, not to mention you're supporting a great small, local business too! 

And, if you're a newbie to seafood, just ask the friendly staff for cooking tips. They offer many great ideas on how to cook the great fish they sell. 

A must see!",2019-10-25 11:26:34

I got the fried seafood combo 4 jumbo fried shrimp 4 sea scallops and 1 piece of fried flounder and comes with fries and cole slaw $13.95 seemed too good to be true which it was... ugh where do I start the jumbo shrimp were far from jumbo they were pre-frozen breaded shrimp (Seapack brand they tasted like) worst shrimp ever then the scallops weren't bad if they were actual whole scallops, looks like they took one jumbo scallop and cut it up into 4 pieces and then breaded it to make the 4. The flounder was not fresh either tasted like pre-frozen already breaded from a bag flounder I took two bites and tossed the rest as for the fries they are the worst fries I ever had in my life and loaded with oil. The only good thing I got was the cole slaw and 2 fresh fried oysters this was the only fresh thing I got with my whole order. I will not be going back here at all!!!",2018-11-29 23:42:24

Service at every point in this transaction was fantastic!  Called once initially to ask about availability/cost, then called again day of to place the order.  Both times whoever answered the phone was knowledgeable and friendly.   The food was ready on time, steamed, fresh, & was absolutely delicious.  They gave us a few free wooden mallets since our order was big, & were very efficient & friendly during pickup & checkout.   We would get fresh seafood from here again anytime!",2021-06-28 19:55:51

I went out to the car immediately and complied.  My mother has moderate dementia and unfortunately had her mask slip down over her nose more than once.  I had to remind her to pull it up. 
The owner was very rude.  She huffed demonstratively. Put her hand on her waist in a disgusted manner.  . My mother sat down at the manicure station and has difficulty understanding sequential instructions.  She put both her hands into the soaking dish instead of just one.  The owner loudly huffed again and chastised my mother which caused unneeded attention to my mother and embarrassed her. 
By the third huff I removed my my mother from the manicure station and left. 
We went to another manicure salon. It was totally different. Masks were optional for vaccinated persons, the people were kind and understanding of the elderly and cognitive issues.  
I could not believe the rudeness of mantra nail salon. 
We all get old.  It's part of life. Kindness and consideration and patience for everyone is important.  Mantra nail salon is owned by Asians who more than likely required patience and kindness to be understood and instructed when they came to this country. Terribly disappointed.",2021-10-23 14:14:11

My husband purchased me a gift card for $50 for my birthday. The gift card has an expiration date! It's only valid for a year! Are you serious? What gift cards have expiration dates? Not to mention it's illegal for gift cards to expire within 5 years! I'll even provide a link to the PA Website that states laws for gift cards! https://www.palawhelp.org/resource/attorney-general-offers-guidance-for-a-hassle-free-holiday-season. I only used $30 on a pedicure (WHICH WAS THE WORST PEDICURE I'VE EVER RECEIVED! I only wanted to use the $20 so it wouldn't go to waste!) They didn't even clean off any dead skin on my feet!) and they wouldn't let me redeem the remaining $20!

NC7fl-xyz84xCHaAxNUBbw,MBvy3glGUhC92iytJ9K-5A,CcKb0khFEMbVMSCjBYNMhA,3,4,1,0,First the good. Seafood is always fresh and reasonably priced. Nice variety of wild fish and farmed. Now the not so good. The customer service is sub par. I walked into the store on numerous occasions and found employees standing about or hiding behind the secret wall and hardly get an acknowledgement or hello. The fish is piled up on trays and does not seem appealing. They would benefit from bringing out less of the inventory and filling in as they sell. The final straw for me this evening when I went to pay for my order they had Trumps smiling mug on a  $100 note with some campaign slogan. I found it offensive. Keep your politics to yourself. I won't be coming back.,2020-07-02 01:27:55
